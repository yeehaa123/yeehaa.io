In biology, an ecosystem is confined to a particular space and time. It is tied to the specific geographic area where a community of living organisms interacts with their physical environment. This space can vary greatly in size, from a small pond, to an expansive forest, or a vast ocean. Each ecosystem is characterized by its unique combination of biotic actors, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and abiotic factors, including climate, soil, water, and topography which can and will change over time. The spatio-temporal boundaries of a biological ecosystem are crucial because they determine the specific interactions and relationships among organisms.

Up until this day, these ecological roots also shape the hyped, non-literal use of the word 'ecosystem'. In fact, the metaphor has been overused and stretched to such extend that it has become a source of both nuisance and ridicule:

> Every crypto has a bloody "ecosystem". Like you're embarking on some excursion into the Brazilian rainforest, and there's speckled finch and poison dart frogs communing with Bernese pythons and friggin orangutans. There is nothing ecological about crypto. There's no birds of paradise. David Attenborough is not there to narrate the mating rituals of Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hodgkins.

While definitely cringeworthy, I actually believe that the inflationary use the term is symptomatic of a positive underlying phenomenon. In fact, it is not the hype that made it a hypernym, but rather the exact opposite. I would argue that the word ecosystem needs to overused because existing, prevalent terms to describe human organizations no longer feel fitting. Company, network, platform, association, circle, pact, club, company, consortium, corporation, establishment, federation, institute, league, party, society, team, family, tribe union: all fail to capture the zeitgeist.

The increased use of the term ecosystem signifies a shift in the wishes and expectations that we hold of human organization. People desire forms of organizations that function in a less mechanical, less hierarchical ways. And the organic connotations of the term ecosystem very much lend themselves to this fulfill craving.

Whereas the etymological roots of the term go a long way to explain its contemporary appeal, I argue that they also keep us from understanding modern ecosystem's full potential. So far, the decisive shift in the meaning of the term has mostly been overlooked. As opposed to their biological counterparts, contemporary artistic, societal and business ecosystems transcend the mere contingent. They have opened the term up to forms of organization that transcend spatio-temporal constraints. Ecosystems are no longer bound to a contiguous territory, but can be dispersed over space and time.

It is not by accident that this shift in meaning happened parallel to the rise and subsequent shattering of the internet. The last few decades has seen an explosion of possibilities to create networks, ventures, and communities that are distributed and asynchronous. 

But this dispersion also made it clear that healthy non-natural ecosystems do not just organically come into fruition and thrive. They do need to be designed and groomed, but in an unforced, open-ended manner. This requires a new practice that I call ecosystem architecture.

Ecosystem architecture, draws its inspiration from many sources: philosophy, gender studies, coding, spirituality, music, dance, visual arts, media theory to name a few. While this mix may seem eclectic or even erratic, there is actually reason to the madness. Natural ecosystems thrive on biodiversity and so do their conceptual antipodes. In order to tackle the challenges ahead of us, no single discipline or practice possesses all the knowledge and wisdom needed. And since ecosystems are wild and eclectic, so are their theoretical underpinnings.
