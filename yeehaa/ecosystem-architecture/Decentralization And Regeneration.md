This series positions ecosystem architecture on the intersection between two specific, adjacent practices: those of [decentralization](https://davidphelps.substack.com/p/visualizing-decentralization) and [regenerative design](https://medium.com/@zahara_chetty/designing-for-the-future-9-principles-of-regenerative-design-568c8966f857).

Decentralization has undeniably been the motor of the late twentieth and early twenty-first century economy. The rise of many Asian countries to economic power houses would not have happened if the US and Europe had not displace their manufacturing oversees. The contemporary internet economy fully depends on the global open source movement delivering high quality software. While technically not the same, globalization inevitably leads to decentralization. When economic, political, and cultural activities are dispersed over time and space, new modes of control and coordination are an absolute must.

Waste generation and accumulation are the shadow side of these modern distributed modes of production. From the [early Frankfurt School](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6356218-grand-hotel-abgrund-eine-photobiographie-der-frankfurter-schule), [the Club of Rome](https://www.clubofrome.org/publication/the-limits-to-growth/), up until the current day [climate movement](https://waag.org/en/article/chris-julien-nieuwsuur-ai-devours-electricity/), the drive for innovation has been equated to the excess mindset. Weirdly enough, that is one of the few thing that eco-warriors and venture capitalists fully agree on. In order to innovate, you need to produce large quantities of trash. I hold, however, that both sides have been looking at it the wrong way. Innovation is not a quality of the technological artifact but rather of the practice that produces it. 

It is in this practical notion of innovation that decentralized and regenerative design meet. Regeneration goes beyond sustainability by not only aiming to restore, but also to renew and revitalize systems and communities. Whereas sustainable design aims for damage control by mitigating harm, regenerative design wants to make ecosystems healthier and more vibrant than ever before. From the perspective of regeneration, the fragments of the internet become seeds of a promising future rather than remainders of a paradise lost. Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, rather than perfection and wholeness, are key to a better future. Ecosystem architecture thus embraces these and related practices wholeheartedly.
