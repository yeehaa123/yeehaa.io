# Align the Misaligned

It is remarkable how the history of virtual space mimics that of its physical counterpart. Like the universe's big bang, better yet, the earth's tectonic shifts, our once one and only internet has shattered into many pieces. To lead with the bad news: no attempt to glue its pieces back together will ever mend it into a whole again. But the fact that something is broken, doesn't mean that it is worth-less. Changing our relation to fragments and waste is key to our planetary future. So why exclude the internet from our new found consciousness? 

In her seminal *Atlas of AI*, Kate Crawford shows that mining and extraction are the foundational cultural techniques of the tech industry. From the [10x mindset of venture capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/books/review-power-law-venture-capital-sebastian-mallaby.html), the [dehumanizing crunches of the game industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/09/04/blood-sweat-and-pixels-book-review-the-brutality-and-beauty-of-building-video-games/amp/), to the [e-waste burial lakes of Baotou](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/atlas-ai-mukul-pal-caia?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare_feed-article-content), so-called innovation always comes at the expense of nature, people, or both. Value is produced by disposing more than is kept. And now that we have almost completely exploited our own planet, outer space has become the next frontier.

 > Extreme wealth and power generated from technology companies now enables a small group of men to pursue their own private space race. They depend on exploiting the knowledge and infrastructures of the public space programs of the twentieth century and often rely on government funding an tax incentives as well. Their aim is not to limit extraction and growth, but to extend it across the solar system.

— Kate Crawford

Fortunately, this excess mindset is running out of steam. The [Taiwan semiconductor crisis](https://www.christophermiller.net/semiconductors-1), [surveillance capitalism](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/), and the [sheer existence of tiktok](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2021/11/e3sconf_netid2021_03029.pdf) are all indicators that the empire is ready to collapse. It is up to us to give it a final push.

This article will reframe internet fragmentation through the lens of [regenerative design](https://www.nrhythm.co/regenerative-design-principles?r_done=1). Regeneration goes beyond sustainability by not only aiming to restore, but also to renew and revitalize systems and communities. Whereas sustainable design aims for damage control by mitigating harm, regenerative design wants to make ecosystems healthier and more vibrant than ever before. Regeneration allows us to see the fragments of the internet as seeds of a promising future rather than remainders of a paradise lost. Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, rather than perfection and wholeness, define our planetary future

## Continental Drift

While the existence and dangers of the Chinese and Russian internet are widely known and debated, the prevalence of this discourse obscures the fact that our 'normal' internet experience has been far from the norm globally for quite a while. In most Asian countries, so-called superapps have replaced browsers and apps as the primary way to interact with the web. Africa is pioneering the adoption of [mesh and P2P networks](https://theflip.africa/podcast/africas-peer-to-peer-story) that creatively give (some form of) internet access to people who cannot afford or rely on stable and persistent connections. Finally, even our own mobile appstore ecosystems should be understood as a break from the open global web, which itself thus needs to be further predicated: let's call it the OG internet for now.

Internet fragmentation goes as far back as least the [browser wars](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/browser-history/) of the mid 1990s. And it would not be wrong to argue that the divide between academic (ARPANET) and defense (DARPANET) purposes may be the internet's original split. Around 2013, virtual continental drift turned into a maelstrom when Edward [Snowden spilled the tea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/no-regrets-says-edward-snowden-after-10-years-in-exile) on governement surveillance. Following a [study](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf) from the World Economic Forum published in 2016, it is now custom to differentiate between three kinds of internet fragmentation. To quote their report directly:

**Technical Fragmentation:** Conditions in the underlying infrastructure that impede the ability of systems to fully interoperate and exchange data packets and of the Internet to function consistently at all end points.

**Governmental Fragmentation:** Government policies and actions that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources.

**Commercial Fragmentation:** Business practices that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources

On all three of these fronts, the Internet Society (ISOC) has made tremendous strides in making these concerns actionable and putting them on the [political agenda](https://www.internetsociety.org/action-plan/2023/). Its aim is to [connect the unconnected](https://www.internetsociety.org/action-plan/community-networks/) by fostering a more connected and interoperable online environment. Through initiatives aimed at promoting open standards, ISOC has played a pivotal role in ensuring that diverse systems can seamlessly communicate and exchange data packets. By advocating for a cohesive and globally accessible internet, the organization has contributed to overcome technical barriers that could impede the internet's functioning across different endpoints. Most importantly, the Internet Society has been instrumental in facilitating collaborative efforts among stakeholders, encouraging the development and adoption of protocols that enhance compatibility.

Alas, when mainstream media and public intellectuals assimilate the issue of internet fragmentation a lot of the nuance and pragmatism gets lost in translation. More precisely, the status quo centers its narrative on restoring the OG Internet. It focuses on what the web was rather than on what it can be. Proponents of this restorative stance can be roughly divided into three camps:

**Past Dwellers**: Pioneers that have a strong investment in, and are nostalgic for the internet's early days . They consider the web's inception as an [exemplary moment](https://www.kennisnet.nl/artikel/14120/het-internet-is-stuk-een-interview-met-marleen-stikker/) in history when free and open global discourse was, and could have stayed, a reality.

**Power Mongers**: Stakeholders whose [(geo)political power](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-DARPA-and-ARPANET) can be challenged, stabilized or expanded through control of the internet. These are mainly countries located in the [Global North](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24590544).

**Gold Diggers**: Parties that [benefit economically](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-heres-how-much-we-give-to-open-source-through-our-github-activity/) from the OG internet. This camp mostly consists of companies that provide 'free' services that are paid for with data.

Underlying the rhetorics of all these manifestations of the restorative stance is a highly idealized version of the early internet. Whereas the nostalgics genuinely believe this narrative, power mongers and gold diggers cynically appropriate it to further their agenda. Nonetheless, it is not misappropriation that is problematic about the internet's origin story. It is the narrative itself. 

A critical reflection of the OG Internet's promises, the conditions under which this assumed historical exception could appear, and the reasons for its quick demise, is long overdue. But, this is neither the place or time for that evaluation. For current purposes, the executive summary needs to suffice: the [digital city](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/de-digitale-stad-van-marleen-stikker-is-nu-unesco-erfgoed-onlinegemeenschap-is-mijlpaal-in-internetgeschiedenis~bb268c8c/) was only inhabitable for those fortunate enough to be born in the right village, the [information superhighway](https://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/information-superhighway.html) only took us to destinations that we wanted to be see. And as long as that privilege was kept implicit, the OG internet could be a place of civil and peaceful discourse.

As soon as the rest of the world got access to the web, the [clash of civilizations](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/opinion/04brooks.html) immediately turned into full-blown culture war. If anything, the internet's short history has made it crystal clear that open access to all information does not lead to universal consensus, trust, and understanding. Quite the opposite, it has lead to an explosion of propaganda, fake news, and identity politics. In short, the OG internet never lived up to its original promise. It rendered our differences visible but did little to nothing to align them.

## Global Village People

In his revelatory works *The Gutenberg Galaxy* (1962) and *Understanding Media*, Marshall McLuhan already predicted that connecting the world through technology wouldn't lead to further unification. Instead, he argued that the connective powers of electricity would turn the world into a [global village](https://medium.com/@maiken_louise/mcluhan-s-global-village-still-relevant-today-1bd4e3792b61): which for McLuhan implied an implosion of time and space. 

 > 
 > Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned.

— Marshall McLuhan

Paradoxically, the resulting contraction would accentuate and heighten differences and lead to a new age of tribalism. Hence the term global *village* which designates the narrow mindedness of its inhabitants.

It is not difficult to find similarities between McLuhan's global village and the contemporary internet. A multitude of tribes are claiming and defending the superiority of their own truths and values, while competing tribes do their best to disqualify and fight them. These clashes go far beyond content alone though. As Friedrich Kittler puts it, the true war is about who is controlling the [channels](https://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Kittler_Friedrich_Gramophone_Film_Typewriter.pdf) that carry the words, sounds, and images. Content is merely there for entertainment purposes.

 > 
 > The Pentagon is engaged in far-sighted planning: only the substitution of optical fibers for metal cables can accommodate the enormous rates and volumes of bits required, spent, and celebrated by electronic warfare. All early warning systems, radar installations, missile bases and army staffs in Europe, the opposite coast, will finally be connected to computers safe from EMP and thus remain operational in wartime. In the meantime, pleasure is produced as a by-product: people are free to channel-surf between entertainment media. After all, fiber optics transmit all messages imaginable save for the one that counts--the bomb. 

— Friedrich Kittler

[Cambridge Analytica](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html), the [Philippine elections](https://thediplomat.com/2022/08/facebook-instagram-purged-millions-of-posts-during-philippine-election/), and the rise of [deep fakes](https://www.engadget.com/tom-hanks-calls-out-dental-ad-for-using-ai-likeness-of-him-161548459.html) are all manifestations of this covert war. Those who in charge of the channels are [freed from the burden](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/eu-warns-elon-musk-that-twitter-x-must-comply-with-fake-news-laws) to defend their truths and values. This thinly disguised war of the gods is the root cause of the current internet fragmentation. 

Attractive as it may be, we should not resort to old dichotomies when we are looking for perpetrators and saviours. In the global village nothing is simple; every relation is complex. The fact that the government is not your enemy, does not make it your friend. Not all companies are evil, but do not trust anyone that says they ain't. And despite the name doing good may not always be the [philanthropist's true motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVeRX3PLFs0). 

Virtue signaling should be seen as the ultimate sign of moral confusion: an expression of complete and utter doubt. Am I truly good person? Any attempt to  answer this question is in vain. Instead, we need to short-circuit the tribal, monotheistic logic that underlies it for once and for all. While there may very well be an objective truth, clear good and evil, and pure beauty, we all have to come to terms with the fact that we will never agree on it. Hence, it does not really matter. Pragmatically, value pluralism is the only way forward.

## Foam Party

Everyday language is overloaded with conceptual [metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By) that either celebrate the whole or lament its absence (broken heart, phantom pain, paradise lost). The fact that these sentiments are so deeply ingrained into our means of communication also explains why it is so difficult to let universality go: *de facto* let alone *de jure*. Even if we are willing to submit ourselves to the existential fact of living without absolute truth, it is still probable that we conceive its absence as a loss. Reframing fragmentation as something positive is next to impossible.

That is why it is admirable that Peter Sloterdijk takes on this challenge against all odds. In the third volume of his Spheres trilogy called *Foams*, he introduces the titular concept — which in German denotes both a noun and a verb — as an antipode to those conceptual metaphors that signify wholeness, unity, and completeness. Foam is a phenomenon that celebrates multiplicity. As a concept, it defies all notions of universality without even referring to it  negatively.

 > 
 > The foam metaphor has the merit of capturing the topological allocation of creative and self-securing creations of living space in an image. It not only reminds us of the tight proximity between fragile units, but also of the necessary self-enclosure of each foam cell, even though they can only exist as users of shared separation installations 

— Peter Sloterdijk

The desire to reverse the effects of separation repeats trauma and causes paralysis. The will to celebrate multiplicity leads to empowerment and creativity. Along with this affirmative act, we should stop calling it internet fragmentation. Fragments only have meaning in relation to a whole that is supposedly lost. In the spirit of Sloterdijk, we should rather call it internet foaming. 

Foam consists of bubbles which, not coincidentally, play a crucial role in the internet's short history. The 1990s witnessed the rise of the infamous dot-com bubble, closely intertwined with the burgeoning landscape of the OG internet. This economic phenomenon, symbolized by an exuberant surge in the valuation of internet-based companies, eventually reached a critical point in 2000 when it abruptly burst. The collapse of the dot-com bubble sent shockwaves across the global economy, ushering in a period of recession that reverberated worldwide.

In recent years, the pervasive influence of filter bubbles has enveloped us. The concept of [filter bubbles](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/how-filter-bubbles-isolate-you/1/) revolves around the idea that biased algorithms curate content based on user behavior, thereby creating echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and isolate individuals from diverse perspectives. While this tailored digital experience caters to our immediate wants and needs, it concurrently impedes and restricts the potential for meaningful connections with others. Instagram and TikTok trapped us in monad without windows.

Or so we have been told! But is the issue of filter bubbles really a problem of today? Is it truly an internet problem? Television, radio, and newspapers were (and are) highly selective in their choices; the Lonely Planet brought the entire Western world to the same hostel in Thailand, and the whole concept of a literary canon is quite literally a massive filter bubble. In other words, the modern internet did not invent the economy and politics of information: it simply intensified its use, multiplied the amount of bubbles, and rendered its effects more apparent. 

More importantly, it is too easy to only focus on the problems. Filter bubbles are not merely determined by misinformation and ignorance, but also by shared values. The inhabitants of these ecosystems relate to each other through what they have in common. They choose to remain in the bubble because, for them, it signifies connectedness, commonality, and solidarity. In their purest form bubbles are seeds; they are potential ecosystems. Popping filter bubbles would thus mean [throwing out the baby with the bathwater](http://course.sdu.edu.cn/G2S/eWebEditor/uploadfile/20140304193156005.pdf). 

Let's stay in the warm and foamy jacuzy, while increasing our awareness of its inherent problems. The two most undesirable side effects of filter bubbles are the two sides of the same coin:

**Entrapment**: The problem of being confined in a bubble where you do not belong. While people can derive incredible support and meaning from shared common values, being trapped in a community with values that are opposed to your own, or even actively threatening your existence, can feel like a prison.

**Solipsism**: This is the condition where you genuinely believe that your bubble is the one and only. If you are too enamored by your community's values, you are bound to overlook its limitations and problems. Every ecosystem is defined by boundaries. A bubble that is good for you can be stifling, or even harmful, to someone else.

From now onwards, the challenge lies in solve these problems without reentering the arena of universal values and norms. As soon as we start bursting bubbles again — either that of someone else or our own — foam reveals its most important characteristic: it has no outside. There is no bird's eye point of view. The outside of a bubble is another bubble. As soon as we truly accept this existential fact, we stop bursting bubbles and begin to foster ecosystems.

## Shenzen Goes HAM

Foam demands rituals and practices that stimulate and facilitate alignment, both within and between different ecosystems. [Decentralization](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/whats-the-difference-between-decentralized-and-distributed-1b8de5e7f5a4) is the umbrella term to cover a multiplicity of cultural techniques that can be employed to achieve this. Despite what crypto-boys, try to make us believe, blockchain, bitcoin, and DAOs are far from the first or the best examples of decentralization. The feudal system, the silk road, and the Greek city states were all built around principles of distributed power and organization. 

In the realm of technology, ham radio is often considered the prime example of decentralization. This applies both to the technology and the community. Ham radio enabled direct peer-to-peer interactions without reliance on centralized infrastructures, while its community embodied a spirit of experimentation, self-reliance, and collaboration, where operators contribute to a network that spans the globe. This model, rooted in the early 20th century, laid the groundwork for all decentralized communities to come.

In the realm of technology, ham radio is often hailed as the prime example of decentralization. This model, rooted in the early 20th century, enabled direct peer-to-peer interactions without reliance on centralized infrastructures, while its community embodied a spirit of experimentation, self-reliance, and collaboration. Up until the current day, ham operators contribute to a network that spans the globe. Resilience  is inherent in ham radio, which is demonstrated by its adaptability to technological challenges and its capacity to maintain communication in times of crisis. Ham radio thereby laid the groundwork for all decentralized communities to come.

Over the last few decades, however, an evolved model of decentralization has  been developed in and around Shenzen. The Shanzhai electronics industry, known for its unconventional and crazy innovations, has become a symbol of technological ingenuity and agility. This ecosystem of smaller manufacturers in China has repeatedly defied conventional norms, producing an array of unique and unexpected devices. From modified versions of popular gadgets to entirely novel creations, Shanzhai is characterized by a daring spirit of experimentation and a rapid pace of innovation. These innovations challenge established industry standards, showcasing the industry's ability to quickly adapt to changing consumer demands and technological trends. 

Shanzhai's ethos of pushing boundaries and embracing creativity has not only carved a distinctive niche in the global electronics market but also serves as a testament to the power of decentralized, collaborative innovation in driving technological progress. Their principles are similar, but slightly different to those seen in the ham radio decentralization model. 

**Peer-to-Peer Collaboration:** Shanzhai, like ham radio, embraces a peer-to-peer approach to collaboration. However, while ham radio focuses on communication protocols and technologies, Shanzhai extends this concept to the entire electronics manufacturing process. The decentralized network witnessed in Shanzhai involves a multitude of actors contributing to the creation of diverse electronic products, marking an evolution from the more specific focus of ham radio. Shanzhai's collaborative model represents an evolution beyond the community-centric ethos of ham radio, expanding into a diverse ecosystem of manufacturers, designers, and innovators.

**Rapid Iterative Innovation:** Both Shanzhai and ham radio share the characteristic of adaptability, but Shanzhai's emphasis on rapid iteration and adaptation in the competitive electronics market represents an evolution from the ham radio model. In Shanzhai, the speed of innovation and adaptation is essential for staying competitive, surpassing the traditional and more leisurely pace often associated with ham radio experimentation.

**Ecosystem-sourced Development**: Central to the Shanzhai approach, manufacturers share intricate blueprints that outline the design and structure of electronic devices, along with bills of materials specifying required components and their sources. This shared information cultivates a dynamic and expansive collaborative environment within the Shanzhai ecosystem. Shanzhai's progressive view on intellectual property (IP), as discussed by Bunnie Huang in his book 'The Hardware Hacker,' further distinguishes its approach, allowing for a more open and flexible innovation ecosystem where ideas and designs are freely shared, fostering rapid advancements in technology. Such collaboration allows various entities to contribute specialized components, accelerating the production process and exemplifying a shift from the community-centric focus of ham radio towards a more extensive and diversified collaborative network.

**Civil Resilience**: Shanzhai electronics exemplify a remarkable level of resilience within the Chinese electronics industry. This resilience is multifaceted, extending beyond technical challenges to address broader economic and societal considerations. In the face of market challenges, supply chain disruptions, and rapidly changing consumer preferences, the Shanzhai model has demonstrated an ability to swiftly adapt and innovate. The decentralized nature of Shanzhai, coupled with the collaborative exchange of information among manufacturers through detailed blueprints and bills of materials, empowers the industry to respond dynamically to external pressures. Furthermore, Shanzhai's resilience has implications for civil resilience by contributing to economic diversification and empowering local communities. The model's adaptability and ability to navigate complexities in the global electronics market underscore its significance not only as an innovative manufacturing approach but also as a contributor to broader societal resilience.

In summary, Shanzhai's model, supported by the sharing of blueprints and bills of materials, represents an evolution of decentralization principles witnessed in ham radio. It expands the scope from communication technologies to encompass the entire electronics manufacturing ecosystem, emphasizing adaptability, collaboration, and resilience in a rapidly changing market.

The Shanzai clearly illustrate why decentralization is not fragmentation. On the contrary, its practices can be used not only reduce and heal the painful effects of foaming, but also to make the bubbles more vibrant and resilient than ever before.

## Garb-Age

It is exactly in this respect that the practice of decentralization has a lot of overlap with that of regeneration. Regenerative design is an approach to designing systems, whether they are natural ecosystems, buildings, or communities, with the goal of improving the environment and society it interacts with. This emerging discipline encompasses a variety of cultural techniques that we can use as inspiration:

**Permaculture:** A conscious and considerate approach to work with nature rather than against it. By emphasizing the thoughtful use of resources such as water, energy, and materials, permaculture intentionally fosters a diverse range of plants, animals, and microorganisms within a given ecosystem.

**Biomimicry:** Replicate the processes, forms, and strategies found in the natural world. 

**Closed-Loop Systems:** waste should be minimized or, better yet, [reconceptualized](https://www.wewakeat.com/product-page/a-making-miso-book-by-erika-hirose). 

In her visionary practice, [Shraddha Borawake](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/shraddha-borawake-garbage-plastic-trash-5760773/) combines all three of these techniques . She deliberately blurs the line between nature and waste. The present and future don't permit is to differentiate any longer. This is also the reason why she calls this era: Garb-Age.

 > 
 > The menacing pile audaciously boasts a landscape of the truth of use and disuse. Metallic composites stand assembled in a landslide of labels, packaging, logos, words, colors, signifiers and barcodes. Oil, butter, preservatives deodorants and other such containers stand witness to the consumption of a small urban sector. Within this miniscule demographic, it exposes a microscopic slice of a number of the sum total of the global lives and livelihoods; that have resulted in this conglomerate of irreducible substance.

— Shraddha Borawake

Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that the blurring goes both ways. Not only does waste needs to be understood as a part of nature. Nature has to be re-framed in terms of waste. That means, it is not one, authentic, and pure. It is distributed, fake, and composed. In other words, not even nature is a universal whole. It is as dispersed as wasted, as fragmented as the internet.

Borawake's Garb-Age demonstrates how decentralization and regenerative design can work together harmoniously to promote sustainable, resilient, and thriving local communities and ecosystems. By giving communities more control over their resources and decision-making processes, they can better apply regenerative design principles to create healthier ecosystems.

## The Good Foot

Internet foaming has opened up one more cultural technique that the OG internet can never offer. The possibility to radically vote with our feet. Where universality makes reality inescapable. The (unfortunately still not fairly distributed) privilege to hop from bubble to bubble is something to not take lightly. Despite its many unfulfilled promises, one of them still remains. The internet allows the creation of communities beyond spatial and temporal boundaries. More than ever before, we have the possibility to create [intentional ecosystems driven by values](https://thenetworkstate.com/) instead of random communities created by temporal-spatio contingency.

**Continuous Just In Time Learning**: Offcourse 2.0

**Trustbased Information Transmission**: evidence-based reputation...

**Ecosystem Sourced Development**: PPS, Stewardship...

While the internet is irrecoverably shattered, we believe that it is possible to prevent the continents from further drifting apart. In order to reconnect the disconnected, however, it is crucial to align the misaligned.
