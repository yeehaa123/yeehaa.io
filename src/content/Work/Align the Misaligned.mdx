# Align the Misaligned

It is remarkable how the history of virtual space mimics that of its physical counterpart. Like the universe's big bang, better yet, the earth's tectonic shifts, our once one and only internet has shattered into many pieces. To lead with the bad news: no attempt to glue its pieces back together will ever mend it into a whole again. But the fact that something is broken, does not mean that it is worth-less. Changing our relation to fragments and waste is key to our planetary future. So why exclude the internet from our new found consciousness? 

In her seminal *Atlas of AI*, Kate Crawford shows that mining and extraction are the foundational cultural techniques of the tech industry. From the [10x mindset of venture capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/books/review-power-law-venture-capital-sebastian-mallaby.html), the [dehumanizing crunches of the game industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/09/04/blood-sweat-and-pixels-book-review-the-brutality-and-beauty-of-building-video-games/amp/), to the [e-waste burial lakes of Baotou](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/atlas-ai-mukul-pal-caia?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare_feed-article-content), so-called innovation always comes at the expense of nature, people, and most frequently both. Value is produced by disposing more than is kept. And now that we have almost completely exploited our own planet, outer space has become the next frontier.

 > Extreme wealth and power generated from technology companies now enables a small group of men to pursue their own private space race. They depend on exploiting the knowledge and infrastructures of the public space programs of the twentieth century and often rely on government funding an tax incentives as well. Their aim is not to limit extraction and growth, but to extend it across the solar system.

â€” Kate Crawford

Fortunately, this excess mindset is running out of steam. The [Taiwan semiconductor crisis](https://www.christophermiller.net/semiconductors-1), [surveillance capitalism](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/), and the [sheer existence of tiktok](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2021/11/e3sconf_netid2021_03029.pdf) are all indicators that the empire is ready to collapse. It is up to us to give it a final push.

In this article, I will use the case of internet fragmentation to develop a new practice called ecosystem architecture. Whereas ecosystems mostly used to be tied to a specific time and place, the last few decades have seen an explosion of possibilities to create networks, business, and communities that transcend the mere contingent. It is not a coincidence that this development runs parallel to the history and the fragmentation of the web. As a matter of fact, these two developments are one and the same. But this dispersion also made it clear that healthy ecosystems do not simply just appear: they need to be designed, but in a a completely non-traditional way.

Ecosystem architecture draws inspiration from many sources: philosophy, gender studies. coding, spirituality, performance arts, media theory to name a few. While this mix may seem eclectic or even eratic, it actually makes a lot of sense. Ecosystems thrive on biodiversity and so does their theoretical underpinnings. Most prominently, though, ecosystem architectures combines elements from decentralized and regenerative design. 

Decentralization has undeniably been the motor of the late twentieth century economy. The rise of many Asian countries to economic power houses would not have happened if the US and Europe did not displace their manufacturing oversees. The internet economy fully depends on the global open source movement delivering high quality software. What was often called globalization was actually decentralization: a dispersion of activities over time and space. 

Waste accumulation has been the shadow side of those modern decentralized modes of production. From the early Frankfurt School, through the Club of Rome report, until the current day climate movement, the drive for innovation has been equated to the excess mindset. Weirdly enough, that's one of the few thing that they and venture capitalism fully agree on. In order to innovate, you need to produce large quantities of trash. I'd argue, however that both sides have been looking at the wrong. Innovation is not a quality of the technological artifact but rather of the practices that produce it. It is a verb, not a noun or an adjective.

It is in this practical notion of innovation that decentralized and regenerative design meet. Regeneration goes beyond sustainability by not only aiming to restore, but also to renew and revitalize systems and communities. Whereas sustainable design aims for damage control by mitigating harm, regenerative design wants to make ecosystems healthier and more vibrant than ever before. Regeneration allows us to see the fragments of the internet as seeds of a promising future rather than remainders of a paradise lost. Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, rather than perfection and wholeness, are key to a better future. Ecosystem architecture thus embraces these notions wholeheartedly.

## Continental Drift

While the existence and dangers of the Chinese and Russian internet are widely known and debated, the prevalence of this discourse obscures the fact that our 'normal' internet experience has been far from the norm globally for quite a while. In most Asian countries, so-called superapps have replaced browsers and apps as the primary way to interact with the web. Africa is pioneering the adoption of mesh and P2P networks that creatively give (some form of) internet access to people who cannot afford or rely on stable and persistent connections. Finally, even our own mobile appstore ecosystems should be understood as a break from the open global web, which itself thus needs to be further predicated: let's call it the OG internet for now.

Internet fragmentation goes as far back as least the browser wars of the mid 1990s. And it would not be wrong to argue that the divide between academic (ARPANET) and defense (DARPANET) purposes may be the internet's original split. Around 2013, virtual continental drift turned into a maelstrom when Edward Snowden spilled the tea on governement surveillance. Following a [study](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf) from the World Economic Forum published in 2016, it is now custom to differentiate between three kinds of internet fragmentation. To quote their report directly:

**Technical Fragmentation:** Conditions in the underlying infrastructure that impede the ability of systems to fully interoperate and exchange data packets and of the Internet to function consistently at all end points.

**Governmental Fragmentation:** Government policies and actions that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources.

**Commercial Fragmentation:** Business practices that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources

On all three of these fronts, the Internet Society (ISOC) has put tremendous effort in making these concerns actionable and putting them on the [political agenda](https://www.internetsociety.org/action-plan/2023/). Its aim is to "connect the unconnected" by fostering a more connected and interoperable online environment. Through initiatives aimed at promoting open standards, ISOC has played a pivotal role in ensuring that diverse systems can seamlessly communicate and exchange data packets. By advocating for a cohesive and globally accessible internet, the organization has contributed to overcome technical barriers that could impede the internet's functioning across different endpoints. Most importantly, the Internet Society has been instrumental in facilitating collaborative efforts among stakeholders, encouraging the development and adoption of protocols that enhance compatibility.

Alas, when mainstream media and public intellectuals assimilate the issue of internet fragmentation a lot of the nuance and pragmatism gets lost in translation. More precisely, the status quo centers its narrative on restoring the OG Internet. It focuses on what the web was rather than on what it can be. Proponents of this restorative stance can be roughly divided into three camps:

**Past Dwellers**: Pioneers that have a strong investment in, and are nostalgic for the internet's early days . They consider the web's inception as an exemplary moment in history when free and open global discourse was, and could have stayed, a reality.

**Power Mongers**: Stakeholders whose (geo)political power can be challenged, stabilized or expanded through control of the internet. These are mainly countries located in the Global North.

**Gold Diggers**: Parties that benefit economically from the OG internet. This camp mostly consists of companies that provide 'free' services that are paid for with data.

Underlying the rhetorics of all these manifestations of the restorative stance is a highly idealized version of the early internet. Whereas the past dwellers genuinely believe this origin story, power mongers and gold diggers cynically appropriate it to further their agenda. Nonetheless, it is not misappropriation that is problematic about the internet's origin story. It is the narrative itself. 

A critical reflection of the OG Internet's promises, the conditions under which this assumed historical exception could appear, and the reasons for its quick demise, is long overdue. But, this is neither the place or time for that evaluation. For current purposes, the executive summary needs to suffice: the digital city was only inhabitable for those fortunate enough to be born in the right village, the information superhighway only took us to destinations that we wanted to be see. And as long as that privilege was kept implicit, the OG internet could be a place of civil and peaceful discourse.

As soon as the rest of the world got access to the web, the clash of civilizations immediately turned into full-blown culture war. If anything, the internet's short history has made it crystal clear that open access to all information does not lead to universal consensus, trust, and understanding. Quite the opposite, it has lead to an explosion of propaganda, fake news, and identity politics. In short, the OG internet never lived up to its original promise. It rendered our differences visible but did little to nothing to align them.

## Global Village People

In his revelatory works *The Gutenberg Galaxy* (1962) and *Understanding Media*, Marshall McLuhan already predicts that connecting the world through technology will not lead to further unification. Rather, the connective powers of electricity, and the technical media built on top of it, will turn the world into a global village.

As information travels rapidly across the globe, traditional distinctions between local and global, as well as between different cultures, are eroded. The concept of global village designates a contraction of space and time, creating a sense of simultaneous existence for people worldwide. 

 > 
 > Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned.

â€” Marshall McLuhan

Paradoxically, while the implosion of time and space effaces some differences, it accentuates and heightens others. McLuhan prophesizes that an omnipresence of technical media will lead to a new age of tribalism. Besides its homogenizing effects, it will also increases the clashes between cultural, political, and reigious tribes. 

Considering the current landscape of the internet, it is safe to say that McLuhan was spot on with his predictions. The modern web is akin to a bustling village. On its busy street corners are competing tribes. Their members are either claiming and defending the superiority of their own truths and values, or they are disqualifying and ridiculing those of others. It is thus not far-fetched to say that the term global *village* also hints at the narrow mindedness of its inhabitants.

Still, these clashes go far beyond content alone though. In *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter* Friedrich Kittler aptly frames the essence of these media wars as a struggle for control over the conduits that transmit words, sounds, and images. Content is a form of entertainment veiled as informational fodder. Bread and circuses provide a captivating backdrop to the overarching battle for dominion over the channels of communication. The internet has become a dynamic arena where factions compete for power, not only in the realm of ideas but also in the infrastructure that shapes the very nature of discourse.

 > 
 > The Pentagon is engaged in far-sighted planning: only the substitution of optical fibers for metal cables can accommodate the enormous rates and volumes of bits required, spent, and celebrated by electronic warfare. All early warning systems, radar installations, missile bases and army staffs in Europe, the opposite coast, will finally be connected to computers safe from EMP and thus remain operational in wartime. In the meantime, pleasure is produced as a by-product: people are free to channel-surf between entertainment media. After all, fiber optics transmit all messages imaginable save for the one that counts--the bomb. 

â€” Friedrich Kittler

[Cambridge Analytica](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html), the [Philippine elections](https://thediplomat.com/2022/08/facebook-instagram-purged-millions-of-posts-during-philippine-election/), and the rise of [deep fakes](https://www.engadget.com/tom-hanks-calls-out-dental-ad-for-using-ai-likeness-of-him-161548459.html) are all manifestations of this covert war. Those who in charge of the channels are [freed from the burden](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/eu-warns-elon-musk-that-twitter-x-must-comply-with-fake-news-laws) to defend their truths and values. This thinly disguised war of the gods is the root cause of the current internet fragmentation. 

Attractive as it may be, we should not resort to old dichotomies when we are looking for perpetrators and saviours. In the global village nothing is simple; every relation is complex. The fact that the government is not your enemy, does not make it your friend. Not all companies are evil, but do not trust anyone that says they are not. And despite the name doing good may not always be the philanthropist's true motivation. 

Virtue signaling should be seen as the ultimate sign of moral confusion: an expression of complete and utter doubt. Am I truly good person? Any attempt to  answer this question is in vain. Instead, we need to short-circuit the tribal, monotheistic logic that underlies it for once and for all. While there may very well be an objective truth, clear good and evil, and pure beauty, we all have to come to terms with the fact that we will never agree on it. Hence, it does not really matter. Pragmatically, value pluralism is the only way forward.

## Foam Party

Everyday language is overloaded with conceptual metaphors that either celebrate the whole or lament its absence: broken heart, phantom pain, paradise lost, etcetera. The fact that these sentiments are so deeply ingrained into our means of communication also explains why it is so difficult to let universality go: *de facto* let alone *de jure*. Even if we are willing to submit ourselves to the existential fact of living without absolute truth, it is still probable that we conceive its absence as a loss. Reframing fragmentation as something positive is next to impossible.

That is why it is admirable that Peter Sloterdijk takes on this challenge against all odds. In the third volume of his Spheres trilogy called *Foams*, he introduces the titular concept â€” which in German denotes both a noun and a verb â€” as an antipode to those conceptual metaphors that signify wholeness, unity, and completeness. Foam is a phenomenon that celebrates multiplicity. As a concept, it defies all notions of universality without even referring to it  negatively.

 > 
 > The foam metaphor has the merit of capturing the topological allocation of creative and self-securing creations of living space in an image. It not only reminds us of the tight proximity between fragile units, but also of the necessary self-enclosure of each foam cell, even though they can only exist as users of shared separation installations 

â€” Peter Sloterdijk

The desire to reverse the effects of separation repeats trauma and causes paralysis. The will to celebrate multiplicity leads to empowerment and creativity. Along with this affirmative act, we should stop calling it internet fragmentation. Fragments only have meaning in relation to a whole that is supposedly lost. In the spirit of Sloterdijk, we should rather call it internet foaming. 

Foam consists of bubbles which, not coincidentally, play a crucial role in the internet's short history. The 1990s witnessed the rise of the infamous dot-com bubble, closely intertwined with the burgeoning landscape of the OG internet. This economic phenomenon, symbolized by an exuberant surge in the valuation of internet-based companies, eventually reached a critical point in 2000 when it abruptly burst. The collapse of the dot-com bubble sent shockwaves across the global economy, ushering in a period of recession that reverberated worldwide.

In recent years, the pervasive influence of filter bubbles has enveloped us. The concept of filter bubbles revolves around the idea that biased algorithms curate content based on user behavior, thereby creating echo chambers that reinforce existing beliefs and isolate individuals from diverse perspectives. While this tailored digital experience caters to our immediate wants and needs, it concurrently impedes and restricts the potential for meaningful connections with others. Instagram and TikTok trapped us in monad without windows.

Or so we have been told! But is the issue of filter bubbles really a problem of today? Is it truly an internet problem? Television, radio, and newspapers were (and are) highly selective in their choices; the Lonely Planet brought the entire Western world to the same hostel in Thailand, and the whole concept of a literary canon is quite literally a massive filter bubble. In other words, the modern internet invented neither the economy nor the politics of information: it simply intensified its use, multiplied the amount of bubbles, and rendered its effects more apparent. 

More importantly, it is too easy to only focus on the problems. Filter bubbles are not merely determined by misinformation and ignorance, but also by shared values. The inhabitants of these ecosystems relate to each other through what they have in common. They choose to remain in the bubble because, for them, it signifies connectedness, commonality, and solidarity. In their purest form bubbles are seeds; they are potential ecosystems. 

Popping filter bubbles would thus mean throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Let's stay in the warm and foamy jacuzy, while increasing our awareness of its inherent problems. The two most undesirable side effects of filter bubbles are the two sides of the same coin:

**Entrapment**: The problem of being confined in a bubble where you do not belong. While people can derive incredible support and meaning from shared common values, being trapped in a community with values that are opposed to your own, or even actively threatening your existence, can feel like a prison.

**Solipsism**: This is the condition where you genuinely believe that your bubble is the one and only. If you are too enamored by your community's values, you are bound to overlook its limitations and problems. Every ecosystem is defined by boundaries. A bubble that is good for you can be stifling, or even harmful, to someone else.

From now onwards, the challenge lies in solve these problems without reentering the arena of universal values and norms. As soon as we start bursting bubbles again â€” either that of someone else or our own â€” foam reveals its most important characteristic: it has no outside. There is no bird's eye point of view. The outside of a bubble is another bubble. As soon as we truly accept this existential fact, we stop bursting bubbles and begin to foster ecosystems.

## Shenzhen Goes HAM

Foam demands rituals and practices that stimulate and facilitate alignment, both within and between different ecosystems. Decentralization is the umbrella term to cover a multiplicity of cultural techniques that can be employed to achieve this. Despite what crypto-boys want us to believe, blockchain, bitcoin, and DAOs are far from the first, let alone the best, manifestations of decentralization. The feudal system, the silk road, and the Greek city states were all built around principles of distributed power and organization. 

In the realm of technology, ham (or amateur) radio is often hailed as the prime example of decentralization. This communication medium, rooted in the early 20th century, enabled direct peer-to-peer interactions without reliance on centralized infrastructures, while its community embodied a spirit of experimentation, self-reliance, and collaboration. Up until the current day, ham operators contribute to a network that spans the globe. Resilience is inherent in ham radio, which is demonstrated by its adaptability to technological challenges and its capacity to maintain communication in times of crisis. Ham radio thereby laid the groundwork for all decentralized communities to come.

Over the last few decades, a newer, and arguably superior, model of decentralization has started to appear in and around Shenzhen. The so-called shanzhai â€” literal meaning: mountain stronghold, slang: to copy or parody â€” known for their unconventional and sometimes flamboyant innovations, have become the avantgarde of technological ingenuity and agility. This ecosystem of smaller manufacturers in China has repeatedly defied conventional norms, producing an array of unique and unexpected devices. From modified but practical versions of popular gadgets (the dual-sim smartphone) to entirely novel creations (a smartphone that look like a pack of Marlboros), the shanzhai are characterized by a daring spirit of experimentation and a rapid pace of innovation. Showcasing the ecosystem's ability to quickly adapt to changing consumer demands and technological trends. 

Initially seen as a gang of shameless copycats, it is through the pioneering work of Andrew 'bunnie' Huang that a more generous and accurate view on the shanzhai has arisen. His book *The Hardware Hacker* is exceptional because his analysis of the Shenzhen ecosystem is free from any preconceived (i.e. Western) notions of innovation and creativity. By doing this, he comes to a vision of the shanzhai's full, future potential.

 > 
 > I have a theory that when the amount of knowledge and the scale of the markets in Shenzhen reach critical mass, the Chinese will stop being simply workers or copiers. They'll take control of their destinies and ultimately, become innovation leaders. These stories about the shanzhai and their mashups are just the tip of an iceberg with the potential to change the way business is done â€” perhaps not in the United States, but certainly in that massive, untapped market often referred to as 'the rest of the world.'

â€”Andrew 'bunnie' Huang

To bunnie, the shanzais' true innovation does not lie in the electronics that they produce. It is the model of production that is the real game changer. Their principles are evolved versions of those seen in the ham radio decentralization model. 

**Peer-to-Peer Collaboration:** Like ham radio, the shanzhai embrace a peer-to-peer approach to collaboration. However, while the amateur radio community focuses on communication protocols and technologies, thee shanzhai extend this concept to the entire electronics manufacturing process. Their decentralized network involves a multitude of actors, ranging from manufacturers and designers to innovator. Collectively this diverse ecosystem contributes to the creation of a plethora of electronic products, marking a clear departure from the more specific focus of ham radio and its rather homogenous community.

**Rapid Iterative Innovation:** The shanzhai's emphasis on rapid iteration and adaptation in the competitive electronics market represents an evolution from the ham radio model. Among the shanzhai, speed of innovation and adaptation is essential for staying competitive, surpassing the traditional and more leisurely pace often associated with ham radio experimentation.

**Resilience**: the shanzhai exemplify a remarkable level of resilience within the Chinese industry. This resilience is multifaceted, extending beyond technical challenges to address broader economic and societal considerations. In the face of market challenges, supply chain disruptions, and rapidly changing consumer preferences, the shanzhai model has demonstrated an ability to swiftly adapt and innovate. The decentralized nature of the shanzhai empowers the industry to respond dynamically to external pressures. Furthermore, its model also leads to an increase in civil resilience by contributing to economic diversification and empowering local communities. The model's adaptability and ability to navigate complexities in the global electronics market underscore its significance not only as an innovative manufacturing approach but also as a contributor to broader societal resilience.

**Ecosystem-sourced Development**: Central to the Shanzhai approach, manufacturers share intricate blueprints that outline the design and structure of electronic devices, along with bills of materials specifying required components and their sources. This shared information cultivates a dynamic and expansive collaborative environment within the Shanzhai ecosystem. Shanzhai's progressive view on intellectual property further distinguishes its approach, allowing for a more open and flexible innovation ecosystem where ideas and designs are freely shared. In *The Hardware Hacker*, this practice is refered to as gongkai.

 > 
 > The West has a 'broadcast' view of IP and ownership: good ideas and innovation are credited to a clearly specified set of authors or inventors, and society pays them a royalty for their initiatives and good works. China has a 'network' view of IP and ownership: one attains the far-reaching sight necessary to create good ideas and innovations by standing on the shoulders of others, and people trade these ideas as favors.

â€” Andrew 'bunnie' Huang

In bunnie's eyes, gongkai (meaning: open or to make public) also challenges that other dominant, contemporary, Western mode of decentralized production: open source. He claims that this model is much more suited for open hardware than its Western counterpart. Without Gongkai, hardware hackers are to either doomed use old-dated and more expensive components, or they have to resort to reverse engineering.

Through gongkai, the shanzhai have created a vibrant ecosystem that is capable of iterating and innovating at an incredible speed, while at the same time being more resilient than most other ecosystems. However, the accelerated pace of production and the constant evolution of electronic devices within the Shenzhen ecosystem comes at a cost. And in the case of the shanzhai it is predominantly nature that pays the price. Its practices of rapid iterations do not only result in innovation, but also in tons and tons of waste. The disposability of outdated components, prototypes, and devices forms the shadow side of the Shenzhen manufacturing landscape. 

While the shanzai breaks with the Silicon Valley model of innovation and IP, they still share  its mindset of exponential growth and excess. If the gongkai model will shape the future technological landscape, it becomes imperative to balance its innovative strengths with environmental considerations, fostering a  regenerative perspective on value creation and waste production.

## Economy of Garbage

Decentralization is not fragmentation. When applied correctly, its cultural techniques can actually smoothen and alleviate the painful effects of foaming. The problem with its most emblematic, contemporary manifestation is that its community got mesmerized by an excess mindset. The original hype around the endless possibilities of blockchain's immutable and incorruptible ledger was entirely replaced by crypto's everyone can get rich instantly pyramid scheme. 

The rise and fall of crypto marked a short resurgence of a mirage that had kept the end of the last millenium under its spell. The 1990's held a sincere believe that capitalism and liberalism had solved all problems and history was close to its completion. Excess, and its antipode scarcity, played a crucial role in that narrative. Cold fusion was going to provide is with an inexhaustible source of energy, and the internet opened up a new with virtual space that revolved around an boundless resource: information. And in such a world without limits, world peace was obvious just around the corner. Then the dotcom bubble bursted, the twin towers were destroyed, and the inconvenient truth of climate change became slowly apparent. 

But while capitalism definitely contributed to it, the excess mindset cannot be entirely reduced to it. As Walter Benjamin most poignantly pointed out in *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction*, the technical affordances of an era define its ideological affordances just as much as vice versa. If modern capitalism relies on extraction and waste production, it is only because that it has means of production at its disposal that facilitate it. 

 > 
 > The field of attention shifts to the person who provides the apparatus. The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.

â€” Walter Benjamin

Benjamin frames modernity as the process that eliminates physical and temporal scarcity as the limiting factor of humanity's progress. For example, cameras â€” even analogue ones â€” can capture a portrait in the same amount of time that it takes a painter to blink his eyes. And while his painting is unique, the camera's snapshot can be reproduced infinitely. Technical innovation was already determined by the 10x mindset centuries before silicon valley decided to cut down its orange orchards. 

The holy grail of capitalism is the discovery of a truly inexhaustible resource. But since scarcity is the ideology's organizing principle, finding it would paradoxically mean its own demise. It is thus not a coincidence that at the same time as Benjamin examined how the world would (stop to) function without scarcity, his close friend and accomplish Georges Bataille explored how an economy of excess would look like.

Like the venture capitalist of today, Bataille encourages activities that may seem wasteful or irrational within traditional economic frameworks. History teaches that it demands significant risks to reap innovative and potentially disruptive ideas. However, where the venture capitalist only focuses on the outliers and disposes the rest, Bataille does the exact opposite and chooses to embrace *The Accursed Share*. 

 > 
 > Expenditure is the magnificence of life; waste, dishonor, and the prodigal son are the disgrace of history.

â€” Georges Bataille

It is exactly this subtle shift in gaze on waste that differentiates the abundance mindset from the excess mindset. Bataille's call for an economy of excess is not a response to a lack of material abundance. On the contrary, it is the affirmation of abundance which lead him to challenge the prevailing emphasis on efficiency and utility. Bataille's observes that there is not too little but too much energy. This abundance is manifested in the outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by life's basic chemical reactions. 

Affirming the fact of abundance is the starting point of Bataille's economy. It leads him to explore the non-utilitarian, symbolic, and psychological dimensions of human experience that can impossibly be fully satisfied by the purely material. As a result, Bataille ends up reconfiguring societal values and the human relationship with excess and wastefulness.

In her visionary practice, Garb-Age, [Shraddha Borawake](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/shraddha-borawake-garbage-plastic-trash-5760773/) follows in Bataille's footsteps by shifting the gaze towards the waste that life produces. She deliberately blurs the lines between nature, culture, and trash. Tourist memorabilia are framed as if they were high art, throwaway lenses are depicted as it they were precious jewels, and all the garbage together shapes a landscape as breath-taking as those painted by the romantics.

 > 
 > The menacing pile audaciously boasts a landscape of the truth of use and disuse. Metallic composites stand assembled in a landslide of labels, packaging, logos, words, colors, signifiers and barcodes. Oil, butter, preservatives deodorants and other such containers stand witness to the consumption of a small urban sector. Within this miniscule demographic, it exposes a microscopic slice of a number of the sum total of the global lives and livelihoods; that have resulted in this conglomerate of irreducible substance.

â€” Shraddha Borawake

Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that the blurring goes in all directions. Not only does waste need to be understood as a part of nature, Borawake's practice shows how nature and culture are defined by the logic of garbage. Concretely that means, they are not one, authentic, and pure, but distributed, fake, and composed. In other words, not even nature is a universal whole. It is as dispersed as wasted, as fragmented as the internet.

## Regenerating the Web

When perceived through the lens of abundance, a decentralized ecosystem has the potential to be more vibrant and resilient than any centralized community can ever be. It is exactly in this respect that the practices of decentralization and regeneration overlap. 

Regenerative design is an approach to designing systems, whether they are natural ecosystems, buildings, or communities, with the goal of improving the environment and society it interacts with. This emerging discipline encompasses a variety of cultural techniques that we can use as inspiration:

**Permaculture:** A conscious and considerate approach to work with nature rather than against it. By emphasizing the thoughtful use of resources such as water, energy, and materials, permaculture intentionally fosters a diverse range of plants, animals, and microorganisms within a given ecosystem.

**Biomimicry:** Replicate the processes, forms, and strategies found in the natural world. 

**Closed-Loop Systems:** waste should be minimized or, better yet, [reconceptualized](https://www.wewakeat.com/product-page/a-making-miso-book-by-erika-hirose). 

Together regenerative design and decentralization can work together harmoniously to promote sustainable, resilient, and thriving local communities and ecosystems. By giving communities more control over their resources and decision-making processes, they can better apply regenerative design principles to create healthier ecosystems.

## The Good Foot

Internet foaming has opened up one more cultural technique that the OG internet can never offer. The possibility to radically vote with our feet. Where universality makes reality inescapable. The (unfortunately still not fairly distributed) privilege to hop from bubble to bubble is something to not take lightly. Despite its many unfulfilled promises, one of them still remains. The internet allows the creation of communities beyond spatial and temporal boundaries. More than ever before, we have the possibility to create intentional ecosystems driven by values instead of random communities created by temporal-spatio contingency.

**Continuous Just In Time Learning**: Offcourse 2.0

**Trustbased Discourse**: evidence-based reputation...

**Ecosystem-sourced Development**: PPS, Stewardship...

While the internet is irrecoverably shattered, we believe that it is possible to prevent the continents from further drifting apart. In order to reconnect the disconnected, however, it is crucial to align the misaligned.
