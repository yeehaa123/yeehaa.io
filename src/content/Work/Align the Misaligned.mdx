# Align the Misaligned

It is remarkable how the history of virtual space mimics that of its physical counterpart. Like the universe's big bang, better yet, the earth's tectonic shifts, our once one and only internet has shattered into many pieces. To lead with the bad news: no attempt to glue its pieces back together will ever mend the internet into a whole again. But the fact that something is broken, doesn't mean that it is worth-less. Changing our relation to fragments and waste is key to our planetary future. So why exclude the internet from our new found consciousness? 

From the [10x mindset of venture capital](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/books/review-power-law-venture-capital-sebastian-mallaby.html), the [dehumanizing crunches of the game industry](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2017/09/04/blood-sweat-and-pixels-book-review-the-brutality-and-beauty-of-building-video-games/amp/), the [e-waste burial lakes of Baotou](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/atlas-ai-mukul-pal-caia?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card_reshare_feed-article-content), so-called innovation always comes at the expense of nature, people, or both. Value is produced by disposing more than is kept. Fortunately, this excess mindset is running out of steam. The [Taiwan semiconductor crisis](https://www.christophermiller.net/semiconductors-1), [surveillance capitalism](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/03/harvard-professor-says-surveillance-capitalism-is-undermining-democracy/), and the [sheer existence of tiktok](https://www.e3s-conferences.org/articles/e3sconf/pdf/2021/11/e3sconf_netid2021_03029.pdf) are all indicators that a shift is long overdue.

This article will reframe internet fragmentation through the lens of [regenerative design](https://www.nrhythm.co/regenerative-design-principles?r_done=1). Regeneration goes beyond sustainability by aiming not only to restore, but also to renew and revitalize systems and communities. Whereas sustainable design aims for damage control by mitigating harm, regenerative design wants to make ecosystems healthier and more vibrant than ever before. Regeneration allows us to see the fragments of the internet as seeds of a promising future rather than remainders of a paradise lost. Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, rather than perfection and wholeness, define our planetary future

## Continental Drift

While the existence and dangers of the Chinese and Russian internet are widely known and debated, the prevalence of this discourse obscures the fact that our 'normal' internet experience has been far from the norm globally for quite a while. In most Asian countries, so-called superapps have replaced browsers and apps as the primary way to interact with the web. Africa is pioneering the adoption of [mesh and P2P networks](https://theflip.africa/podcast/africas-peer-to-peer-story) that creatively give (some form of) internet access to people who cannot afford or rely on stable and persistent connections. Finally, even our own mobile appstore ecosystems should be understood as a break from the open global web, which itself thus needs to be further predicated: let's call it the OG internet for now.

Internet fragmentation goes as far back as least the [browser wars](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/browser-history/) of the mid 1990s. And it would not be wrong to argue that the divide between academic (ARPANET) and defense (DARPANET) purposes may be the internet's original split. Around 2013, virtual continental drift turned into a maelstrom when Edward [Snowden spilled the tea](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/08/no-regrets-says-edward-snowden-after-10-years-in-exile) on governement surveillance. Following a [study](https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_FII_Internet_Fragmentation_An_Overview_2016.pdf) from the World Economic Forum published in 2016, it is now custom to differentiate between three kinds of internet fragmentation. To quote their report directly:

**Technical Fragmentation:** Conditions in the underlying infrastructure that impede the ability of systems to fully interoperate and exchange data packets and of the Internet to function consistently at all end points.

**Governmental Fragmentation:** Government policies and actions that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources.

**Commercial Fragmentation:** Business practices that constrain or prevent certain uses of the Internet to create, distribute, or access information resources

Organizations such as the Internet Society have made a tremendous effort in making these concerns actionable and putting them on the [political agenda](https://www.internetsociety.org/action-plan/2023/). Alas, when mainstream media and public intellectuals assimilate the issue a lot of the nuance and pragmatism gets lost in translation. 

More precisely, the status quo centers its narrative on restoring what was rather than working towards what could be. Proponents of this restorative stance can be roughly divided into three camps:

1. Those who have a strong sense of [nostalgia](https://www.kennisnet.nl/artikel/14120/het-internet-is-stuk-een-interview-met-marleen-stikker/) of the internet's early days.

1. Those whose [(geo)political power](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-DARPA-and-ARPANET) can be challenged, stabilized or expanded through control of the internet.

1. Those who [benefit economically](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-heres-how-much-we-give-to-open-source-through-our-github-activity/) from the OG internet.

Underlying the rhetoric of all these manifestations of the restorative stance is a highly idealized version of the early internet. A critical reflection of its promises, the conditions under which this historical exception could appear, and the reasons for its quick demise, is long overdue. But, this is neither the place or time for that evaluation. 

For current purposes, the executive summary needs to suffice: the [digital city](https://www.parool.nl/amsterdam/de-digitale-stad-van-marleen-stikker-is-nu-unesco-erfgoed-onlinegemeenschap-is-mijlpaal-in-internetgeschiedenis~bb268c8c/) was only inhabitable for those fortunate enough to be born in the right city, the [information superhighway](https://www2.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/information-superhighway.html) only took us to destinations that we wanted to be see. And as long as that privilege was kept implicit, the OG internet could be a place of civil and peaceful discourse.

As soon as the rest of the world got access to the web, the [clash of civilizations](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/04/opinion/04brooks.html) immediately turned into full-blown culture war. If anything, the internet's short history has made it crystal clear that open access to all information does not lead to universal consensus, trust, and understanding. Quite the opposite, it has lead to an explosion of propaganda, fake news, and identity politics. In short, the OG internet never lived up to its original promise. It rendered our differences visible but did little to nothing to align them.

## Global Village People

In his revelatory works *The Gutenberg Galaxy* (1962) and *Understanding Media*, Marshall McLuhan already predicted that connecting the world through technology wouldn't lead to further unification. McLuhan argued that the connective powers of electricity would turn the world into a [global village](https://medium.com/@maiken_louise/mcluhan-s-global-village-still-relevant-today-1bd4e3792b61): which for him implied an implosion of time and space. 

 > 
 > Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned.

— Marshall McLuhan

Paradoxically, the resulting contraction would accentuate and heighten differences and lead to a new age of tribalism. Hence the term global *village* which designates the narrow mindedness of its inhabitants.

It is not difficult to find similarities between McLuhan's global village and the contemporary internet. Different tribes are defending the superiority of their own truths and values, while competing tribes do their best to disqualify and fight them. These clashes go far beyond content alone though. As Friedrich Kittler puts it, the true war is about who is controlling the [channels](https://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Kittler_Friedrich_Gramophone_Film_Typewriter.pdf) that carry the words, sounds, and images. Content is merely there for entertainment purposes.

 > 
 > The Pentagon is engaged in far-sighted planning: only the substitution of optical fibers for metal cables can accommodate the enormous rates and volumes of bits required, spent, and celebrated by electronic warfare. All early warning systems, radar installations, missile bases and army staffs in Europe, the opposite coast,\[1\] will finally be connected to computers safe from EMP and thus remain operational in wartime. In the meantime, pleasure is produced as a by-product: people are free to channel-surf between entertainment media. After all, fiber optics transmit all messages imaginable save for the one that counts--the bomb. 

— Friedrich Kittler

[Cambridge Analytica](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html), the [Philippine elections](https://thediplomat.com/2022/08/facebook-instagram-purged-millions-of-posts-during-philippine-election/), and the rise of [deep fakes](https://www.engadget.com/tom-hanks-calls-out-dental-ad-for-using-ai-likeness-of-him-161548459.html) are all manifestations of this covert war. Those who in charge of the channels are [freed from the burden](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/eu-warns-elon-musk-that-twitter-x-must-comply-with-fake-news-laws) to defend their truths and values. This thinly disguised war of the gods is the root cause of the current internet fragmentation. 

Attractive as it may be, we should not resort to old dichotomies when we are looking for perpetrators and saviours. In the global village nothing is simple; every relation is complex. The fact that the government is not your enemy, does not make it your friend. Not all companies are evil, but do not trust anyone that says they ain't. And despite the name doing good may not always be the [philanthropist's true motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVeRX3PLFs0). 

Virtue signaling may be an expression of complete and utter doubt: am I truly good person? In order to finally end this moral confusion, the underlying tribal, monotheistic logic needs to be short-circuited. While there may very well be an objective truth, clear good and evil, and pure beauty, we all have to come to terms with the fact that we will never agree on it.  Hence, it does not really matter. Pragmatically, value pluralism is the only way forward.

## Foam Party

Everyday language is overloaded with conceptual [metaphors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphors_We_Live_By) that either celebrate the whole or lament its absence (broken heart, phantom pain, paradise lost). The fact that these sentiments are so deeply ingrained into our means of communication also explains why it is so difficult to let universality go: *de facto* let alone *de jure*. Even if we are willing to submit ourservels to the existential fact of living without absolute truth, it is still probable that we conceive its absence as a loss. Reframing fragmentation as something positive is next to impossible.

That is why it is admirable that Peter Sloterdijk takes on this challenge against all odds. In the third volume of his Spheres trilogy called *Foams*, he introduces the titular concept — which in German denotes both a noun and a verb — as an antipode to those conceptual metaphors that signify wholeness, unity, and completeness. Foam is a phenomenon that celebrates multiplicity. As a concept, it defies all notions of universality without even referring to it  negatively.

 > 
 > The foam metaphor has the merit of capturing the topological allocation of creative and self-securing creations of living space in an image. It not only reminds us of the tight proximity between fragile units, but also of the necessary self-enclosure of each foam cell, even though they can only exist as users of shared separation installations” 

— Peter Sloterdijk

The desire to reverse the effects of separation repeats trauma and causes paralysis. The will to celebrate multiplicity leads to empowerment and creativity. Along with this affirmative act, we should stop calling it internet fragmentation. Fragments only have meaning in relation to a whole that is supposedly lost. Following Sloterdijk, we should talk about internet foaming. 

Foam consists of bubbles which, not coincidentally, play a crucial role in the internet's short history. In the 1990's, the [dot-com bubble](https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/d/dot-com-bubble-and-burst) grew along with the OG internet, until it bursted in 2000 and took the entire world in a recession. Over the last few years, we all got captured in [filter bubbles](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/digital-media-literacy/how-filter-bubbles-isolate-you/1/) that present us with a world tailored to our wants and needs but that hinders and preclude the connections with others. 

Attempts to pop these filter bubbles confronts u with foam's most important characteristic: it has no outside, there is no bird's eye point of view. The outside of a bubble is another bubble. As soon as we have truly accepted this existential fact, the challenge is no longer to pop bubbles but to align them: both internally and externally. 

## We Go Ham

[Decentralization](https://medium.com/nakamo-to/whats-the-difference-between-decentralized-and-distributed-1b8de5e7f5a4) is the umbrella term to cover a multiplicity of cultural techniques that can be employed to achieve this. \[TODO: couple of examples\] Ham radio, also known as amateur radio, is a good example of decentralization for several reasons:

Peer-to-Peer Communication:

Ham radio operates on a peer-to-peer basis, allowing individuals to communicate directly with each other without relying on a centralized infrastructure. Unlike traditional communication systems that depend on centralized broadcasting towers or networks, ham radio operators communicate directly with each other using radio frequencies.
Decentralized Licensing and Regulation:

Ham radio operators are required to obtain licenses from regulatory authorities, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. However, once licensed, operators have a considerable degree of autonomy in their communication activities. The regulatory framework is designed to ensure responsible and interference-free operation, but it doesn't involve micromanaging the content or purpose of individual communications.
Resilience in Emergencies:

Ham radio is known for its resilience in times of emergencies. During natural disasters or other crises when traditional communication infrastructure may fail, ham radio operators can quickly set up and establish communication networks. This decentralized and independent communication capability is crucial for coordinating emergency response efforts, providing assistance, and disseminating information when centralized systems are compromised.
Community and Collaboration:

The ham radio community is characterized by collaboration and a sense of shared interest. Operators often form local clubs, participate in events, and collaborate on various projects. The decentralized nature of ham radio allows for the formation of diverse communities with a common interest in radio communication.
Experimentation and Innovation:

Ham radio encourages experimentation and innovation in radio communication technologies. Operators can build and modify their equipment, antennas, and systems, fostering a culture of continuous learning and technological exploration. This decentralized approach to technology development allows for a wide range of solutions tailored to individual preferences and needs.
In summary, ham radio exemplifies decentralization by enabling direct peer-to-peer communication, operating within a decentralized regulatory framework, providing resilience in emergencies, fostering community collaboration, and encouraging experimentation and innovation in radio communication technologies.

Decentralization is not fragmentation. On the contrary, it can be used not only reduce and heal the painful effects of foaming, but also to make the bubbles more vibrant and resilient than ever before.

## Garb-Age

It is exactly in this respect that the practice of decentralization has a lot of overlap with that of regeneration. Regenerative design is an approach to designing systems, whether they are natural ecosystems, buildings, or communities, with the goal of improving the environment and society it interacts with. This emerging discipline encompasses a variety of cultural techniques that we can use as inspiration:

**Permaculture:** A conscious and considerate approach to work with nature rather than against it. By emphasizing the thoughtful use of resources such as water, energy, and materials, permaculture intentionally fosters a diverse range of plants, animals, and microorganisms within a given ecosystem.

**Biomimicry:** Replicate the processes, forms, and strategies found in the natural world. 

**Closed-Loop Systems:** waste should be minimized or, better yet, [reconceptualized](https://www.wewakeat.com/product-page/a-making-miso-book-by-erika-hirose). 

In her visionary practice, [Shraddha Borawake](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/shraddha-borawake-garbage-plastic-trash-5760773/) combines all three of these techniques . She deliberately blurs the line between nature and waste. The present and future don't permit is to differentiate any longer. This is also the reason why she calls this era: Garb-Age.

Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that the blurring goes both ways. Not only does waste needs to be understood as a part of nature. Nature has to be re-framed in terms of waste. That means, it is not one, authentic, and pure. It is distributed, fake, and composed. In other words, not even nature is a universal whole. It is as fragmented as the internet.

Borawake's Garb-Age demonstrates how decentralization and regenerative design can work together harmoniously to promote sustainable, resilient, and thriving local communities and ecosystems. By giving communities more control over their resources and decision-making processes, they can better apply regenerative design principles to create healthier ecosystems.

## The Good Foot

Internet foaming has opened up one more cultural technique that the OG internet can never offer. The possibility to radically vote with our feet. Where universality makes reality inescapable. The (unfortunately still not fairly distributed) privilege to hop from bubble to bubble is something to not take lightly. Despite its many unfulfilled promises, one of them still remains. The internet allows the creation of communities beyond spatial and temporal boundaries. More than ever before, we have the possibility to create [intentional ecosystems driven by values](https://thenetworkstate.com/) instead of random communities created by temporal-spatio contingency.

While the internet is irrecoverably shattered, we believe that it is possible to prevent the continents from further drifting apart. In order to reconnect the disconnected, however, it is crucial to align the misaligned.
