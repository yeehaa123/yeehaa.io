    title: Align the Misaligned
    author: yeehaa
    summary: The fragmentation of the internet mirrors both the Earth’s tectonic
      shifts and the exploitative practices of the tech industry. Yet,
      brokenness does not imply worthlessness. Embracing fragmented systems, the
      article proposes ‘ecosystem architecture,’ a new approach inspired by
      decentralization and regenerative design. By fostering an
      interdisciplinary mix from philosophy to coding, the aim is to create
      vibrant, sustainable digital ecosystems. These systems, though scattered,
      can be innovative seeds for the future, promoting a healthier, more
      dynamic environment.
    excerpt: Fragmentation of the internet mirrors Earth's tectonic shifts and
      exploitative tech practices. Embracing fragmented systems, 'ecosystem
      architecture' aims for creating vibrant, sustainable digital ecosystems.

    title: Continental Drift
    author: yeehaa
    summary: "The article 'Continental Drift' discusses the fragmentation of the
      internet, contrasting the conventional Western experience with global
      variations like Asia's superapps and Africa's mesh networks. It identifies
      three types of internet fragmentation: technical, governmental, and
      commercial, and critiques the idealized view of the early internet held by
      various groups. The Internet Society's efforts to enhance global internet
      connectivity are also highlighted."
    excerpt: The article examines internet fragmentation, contrasting the
      traditional Western experience with global variations like superapps and
      mesh networks. It critiques the idealized view of the early internet and
      covers ISOC's efforts for better connectivity.

    title: Global Village People
    author: yeehaa
    summary: Marshall McLuhan predicted that electric technology would turn the
      world into a 'global village,' eroding the distinctions between local and
      global cultures. While this creates a sense of unity, it also intensifies
      tribalism and cultural clashes, as seen on the internet today. The modern
      web is a battleground for control over communication channels and ideas.
      The pervasive media creates distractions while hiding deeper struggles for
      power. Friedrich Kittler asserts that this media war extends beyond
      content to control infrastructure. Examples like Cambridge Analytica and
      the rise of deep fakes illustrate this ongoing conflict, indicating that
      we must navigate complex relationships and value pluralism.
    excerpt: Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would create a 'global
      village,' eroding local-global distinctions while intensifying tribalism.
      The internet is now a battleground for communication control.
