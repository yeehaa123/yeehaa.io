    title: Align the Misaligned
    author: yeehaa
    summary: The history of virtual space parallels physical space's fragmentation,
      leaving the internet shattered and irreparable. Mining and extraction
      drive the tech industry, causing environmental and social damages.
      Ecosystem architecture, inspired by decentralization and regenerative
      design, offers a new approach to harnessing the fragmented internet,
      turning waste into innovation. It emphasizes the importance of designing
      biodiverse conceptual ecosystems that thrive through interdisciplinary
      collaboration for a regenerative future.
    excerpt: Ecosystem architecture reimagines the fragmented internet, drawing on
      interdisciplinary knowledge and regenerative design to transform waste
      into innovation and foster vibrant, decentralized ecosystems.

    author: yeehaa
    summary: "The article 'Continental Drift' discusses the fragmentation of the
      internet, contrasting the conventional Western experience with global
      variations like Asia's superapps and Africa's mesh networks. It identifies
      three types of internet fragmentation: technical, governmental, and
      commercial, and critiques the idealized view of the early internet held by
      various groups. The Internet Society's efforts to enhance global internet
      connectivity are also highlighted."
