# Learning from Nature

When perceived through the lens of abundance, decentralized ecosystems have the potential to be more vibrant and resilient than any centralized community or organization can ever be. By giving communities more control over their resources and decision-making processes, they become increasingly empowered to collaboratively create healthier ecosystems. It is exactly in this north star vision where the practices of decentralization and regeneration meet.

 > Design for resilient and regenerative cultures is about facilitating positive emergence, co-creating collaborative networks of relationships that nurture the conditions in which we (life) can meet uncertainty with creativity, adaptive capacity and a readiness to transform in response to change and disruption.

— Daniel Christian Wahl

Regeneration is an approach to designing systems. Its applications are wide-ranging: from physical spaces such as natural ecosystems, towns, and buildings to more abstract ones like communities, initiatives, and ventures. What defines this practice in all these different contexts is the underlying goal: the designed spaces should improve the environment and society that they interact with in a sustainable way. In order to accomplish this goal, regenerative design employs a plethora of cultural techniques. For current purposes I will only zoom in on the following two:

**Permaculture**: This concept, coined by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, is a portmanteau combining permanent and (agri)culture. Permaculture is a conscious and considerate approach to work with nature rather than against it. By emphasizing the thoughtful use of resources such as water, energy, and materials, permaculture intentionally fosters a diverse range of plants, animals, and microorganisms within a given ecosystem.

**Biomimicry**: The practice of replicating the processes, forms, and strategies found in the natural world. This idea was popularized by biologist and author Janine Benyus who, in her book titled *Biomimicry: Innovation Inspired by Nature* (1997), explores how nature's designs, processes, and systems can serve as inspiration for human innovation across various fields, including design, engineering, and technology.

While different in scope, activity, and outcomes, permaculture and biomimicry share a deep desire to learn from nature. Whereas modern natural sciences are aimed at predicting, controlling, and exploiting the biosphere, these contemporary regenerative alternatives try to avoid such hierarchical power relations. Their stance towards nature is better understood as a dialogue: they listen and talk to it. This conversation does not limit itself to nature in the strict sense of the word: it extends to culture, the past, and ultimately the entire universe. That makes regeneration first and foremost a practice of alignment.

But in order to align, one first has to learn to truly listen. In *Designing Regenerative Cultures* (2016), Daniel Christian Wahl asks the question: what can we learn from natural ecosystems? His surprising answer is: collaboration. Darwinism with its emphasis on competition, scarcity has lead to a complete misrepresentation of how nature works. Modern biology, Wahl claims, has unveiled that ecosystems works towards optimal health for the whole.

 > 
 > All our actions affect the sustainability, resilience and health of the communities in which we live, work and learn. The relationships we create and the collective vision of the future we create with our communities will shape whether they are sustainable and capable of regeneration. The community level is where we can all contribute to the emergence of a regenerative culture. The nested networks of interactions we co-create shape the present and future of our community and its participation in local ecosystems.

— Daniel Christian Wahl

Collaboration is not an ethical imperative but rather a natural fact. Competition exists, of course, but mainly as a short time measure. It is an intervention that corrects imbalances or stagnation. Over longer periods, the participants in thriving ecosystems develop ways to collaborate without a central instance of control. Through continuous alignment, they organically work towards an optimal configuration for the entire system. The achieved optimum, however, is never permanent and never perfect.
