# Economy of Garbage

Decentralization is not fragmentation. When applied correctly, its cultural techniques can actually smoothen and alleviate the painful effects of foaming. The problem with its most emblematic, contemporary manifestation is that its community got mesmerized by an excess mindset. The original hype around the endless possibilities of blockchain's immutable and incorruptible ledger was entirely replaced by crypto's everyone can get rich instantly pyramid scheme.

The rise and fall of crypto marked a short resurgence of a mirage that had kept the end of the last millenium under its spell. The 1990's held a sincere believe that capitalism and liberalism had solved all problems and history was close to its completion. Excess, and its antipode scarcity, played a central role in that narrative. Cold fusion was going to provide us with an inexhaustible source of energy, and the internet opened up a new with virtual space that revolved around an boundless resource: information. And in such a world without limits, universal peace was obviously just around the corner. Then the dotcom bubble bursted, the twin towers were destroyed, and the inconvenient truth of climate change became slowly apparent.

But while capitalism definitely did little to nothing to question it, the excess mindset cannot be entirely reduced to it either. As Walter Benjamin most poignantly pointed out in *The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction* (1935), the technical affordances of an era define its ideological affordances just as much as vice versa. If modern capitalism relies on extraction and waste production, it is only because it relies on means of production that facilitate it.

 > The field of attention shifts to the person who provides the apparatus. The public is an examiner, but an absent-minded one.

— Walter Benjamin

Benjamin frames modernity as the process that eliminates physical and temporal scarcity as the limiting factor of humanity's material progress. For example, cameras — even analogue ones — can capture a portrait in the same amount of time that it takes a painter to blink his eyes. And while his painting is unique, the camera's snapshot can be reproduced infinitely. Technical innovation was already determined by the 10x mindset centuries long before silicon valley decided to cut down its orange orchards.

The holy grail of capitalism is the discovery of a truly inexhaustible resource. But since scarcity is the ideology's organizing principle, finding it would paradoxically mean its own demise. It is thus not a coincidence that at the same time as Benjamin examined how the world would (stop to) function without scarcity, his close friend and accomplish Georges Bataille started exploring how an economy of excess would look like in his early essay *The Notion of Expenditure*. A theme that would define his entire oeuvre.

Like the venture capitalist of today, Bataille encourages activities that may seem wasteful or irrational within traditional economic frameworks. History teaches that it demands significant risks to reap innovative and potentially disruptive ideas. However, where the venture capitalist only focuses on the outliers and disposes the rest, Bataille does the exact opposite and chooses to embrace *The Accursed Share* (1949).

 > Expenditure is the magnificence of life; waste, dishonor, and the prodigal son are the disgrace of history.

— Georges Bataille

It is exactly this subtle shift in gaze that differentiates the abundance mindset from the excess mindset. Waste is not to be discarded with shame, it needs to be proudly embraced. Bataille's call for an economy of excess is not a response to a lack of material abundance. On the contrary, it is the affirmation of abundance which leads him to challenge the prevailing emphasis on efficiency and utility. Bataille's observes that there is far too much rather than too little energy. This abundance is manifested in the outpouring of solar energy or the surpluses produced by life's basic chemical reactions.

Affirming the fact of abundance is the starting point of Bataille's economy of excess. It leads him to explore the non-utilitarian, symbolic, and psychological dimensions of human experience that can impossibly be fully satisfied by the purely material. As a result, Bataille ends up reconfiguring societal values and the human relationship with excess and wastefulness.

In her visionary practice, *Garb-Age*, Shraddha Borawake follows in Bataille's footsteps by shifting the gaze towards the waste that life produces. She constantly blurs the lines between nature, culture, and trash. Tourist memorabilia are framed as if they were high art, throwaway lenses are depicted as it they were precious jewels, and all the garbage together shapes a landscape as breath-taking as those painted by the romantics.

 > The menacing pile audaciously boasts a landscape of the truth of use and disuse. Metallic composites stand assembled in a landslide of labels, packaging, logos, words, colors, signifiers and barcodes. Oil, butter, preservatives deodorants and other such containers stand witness to the consumption of a small urban sector. Within this miniscule demographic, it exposes a microscopic slice of a number of the sum total of the global lives and livelihoods; that have resulted in this conglomerate of irreducible substance.

— Shraddha Borawake

Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that the blurring goes in all directions. Borawake's practice shows that waste is not outside of nature and culture but very much at its core. This also means that these realms are not devoid of the logic of garbage. Nature and culture are not one, authentic, and pure, but rather distributed, fake, and composed. After the holocaust we have learned to be critical of the rhetorics of purity and authenticity when it comes to culture, but nature has mostly managed to be unaffected by this critique. Borawake ends that state of exception. Not even nature is a universal whole. It is as dispersed as waste, as fragmented as the internet. Nature is abundance in excess: it is foaming.
