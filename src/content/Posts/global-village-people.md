summary: Marshall McLuhan predicted that electric technology would turn the
  world into a 'global village,' eroding the distinctions between local and
  global cultures. While this creates a sense of unity, it also intensifies
  tribalism and cultural clashes, as seen on the internet today. The modern web
  is a battleground for control over communication channels and ideas. The
  pervasive media creates distractions while hiding deeper struggles for power.
  Friedrich Kittler asserts that this media war extends beyond content to
  control infrastructure. Examples like Cambridge Analytica and the rise of deep
  fakes illustrate this ongoing conflict, indicating that we must navigate
  complex relationships and value pluralism.

# Global Village People

In his revelatory works *The Gutenberg Galaxy* (1962) and *Understanding Media* (1964), Marshall McLuhan already predicts that connecting the world through technology will not lead to further unification. Rather, the connective powers of electricity, and the technical media built on top of it, will turn the world into a global village.

As information travels rapidly across the globe, traditional distinctions between local and global, as well as between different cultures, are eroded. The concept of global village designates a contraction of space and time, creating a sense of simultaneous existence for people worldwide.

 > 
 > Today, after more than a century of electric technology, we have extended our central nervous system itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time as far as our planet is concerned.

— Marshall McLuhan

Paradoxically, while the implosion of time and space effaces some differences, it accentuates and heightens others. McLuhan prophesizes that an omnipresence of technical media will lead to a new age of tribalism. Besides its homogenizing effects, it will also increases the clashes between cultural, political, and religious tribes.

Considering the current landscape of the internet, it is safe to say that McLuhan was spot on with his predictions. The modern web is akin to a bustling village. On its busy street corners we find competing tribes. Their members are either claiming and defending the superiority of their own truths and values, or they are disqualifying and ridiculing those of others. It is thus not far-fetched to claim that the term global *village* also hints at the narrow mindedness of its inhabitants.

Still, these clashes go far beyond content alone In *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter* (1987), Friedrich Kittler aptly frames the essence of these media wars as a struggle for control over the conduits that transmit words, sounds, and images. Our media are overloaded with entertaining distractions thinly veiled as information. Bread and circus provides a captivating backdrop to the overarching battle for dominion over the channels of communication. The internet has become a dynamic arena where factions compete for power, not only in the realm of ideas but also in the infrastructure that shapes the very nature of discourse.

 > The Pentagon is engaged in far-sighted planning: only the substitution of optical fibers for metal cables can accommodate the enormous rates and volumes of bits required, spent, and celebrated by electronic warfare. All early warning systems, radar installations, missile bases and army staffs in Europe, the opposite coast, will finally be connected to computers safe from EMP and thus remain operational in wartime. In the meantime, pleasure is produced as a by-product: people are free to channel-surf between entertainment media. After all, fiber optics transmit all messages imaginable save for the one that counts--the bomb.

— Friedrich Kittler

Cambridge Analytica, the latest Philippine elections, the rebranding of twitter to X, and the rise of deep fakes are all manifestations of this covert war. Those who in charge of the channels are freed from the burden to defend their truths and values. This thinly disguised war of the gods is the root cause of the current internet fragmentation.

Attractive as it may be, we should not resort to old dichotomies when we are looking for perpetrators and saviours. In the global village nothing is simple; every relation is complex. The fact that the government is not your enemy, does not make it your friend. Not all companies are evil, but do not trust anyone that says they are not. And despite the name doing good may not always be the philanthropist's true motivation.

Virtue signaling needs to be understood as the ultimate sign of moral confusion: an expression of complete and utter doubt. Am I truly good person? Any attempt to answer this question is in vain. Instead, we need to short-circuit the tribal, monotheistic logic that underlies it for once and for all. While there may very well be an objective truth, clear good and evil, and pure beauty, we all have to come to terms with the fact that we will never agree on it. Hence, it does not really matter. Pragmatically, value pluralism is the only way forward.
