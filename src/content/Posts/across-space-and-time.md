excerpt: The term 'ecosystem' has evolved beyond biology to describe dynamic,
  non-bounded human organizations, transcending space and time. Introduction to
  'ecosystem architecture,' a multidisciplinary practice.
summary: The article explores the evolution of the term 'ecosystem' from its
  biological roots, describing a space where organisms interact within specific
  spatio-temporal boundaries, to its metaphorical use in human organizations
  such as cryptocurrencies and businesses. The piece argues for a broader, less
  bounded interpretation of ecosystems that can transcend space and time. It
  introduces 'ecosystem architecture,' a new practice that draws from diverse
  fields to design human ecosystems that thrive beyond traditional constraints.

In biology, an ecosystem is defined by a particular space and time. It is tied to the specific geographic area where a community of living organisms interacts with their physical environment. This space can vary greatly in size, from a small pond to an expansive forest or a vast ocean. Each ecosystem is characterized by its unique combination of biotic components, such as plants, animals, and microorganisms, and abiotic factors, including climate, soil, water, and topography which can and will change over time. The spatio-temporal boundaries of a biological ecosystem are crucial because they determine the specific interactions and relationships among organisms.

Up until this very day, these etymological origins have also shaped and constrained its transferred conceptual meaning which have now extended far beyond its biological roots. 

> Every crypto has a bloody "ecosystem". Like you're embarking on some excursion into the Brazilian rainforest, and there's speckled finch and poison dart frogs communing with Bernese pythons and friggin orangutans. There is nothing ecological about crypto. There's no birds of paradise. David Attenborough is not there to narrate the mating rituals of Vitalik Buterin and Charles Hodgkins.

While many believe that this hype-driven metaphorical use of the term has inflated its meaning, but I actually believe that this misses the point. The term ecosystem has not become portmanteau because of the hype, but rather the opposite. It marks the failing of existing, prevalent terms to describe human organizations.

The increased use of the term ecosystem is a symptom of an underlying shift in expectations that we hold of human organization. People desire forms of organizations that functions in a less mechanical, less hierarchical ways, and the biological roots and organic connotations of the term ecosystem very much lends itself to this desire.

Still, I also hold that it are these same linguistic origins that prevent ecosystems from reaching their full potential. So far, a crucial shift in the meaning of the term has mostly been overlooked. As opposed to their biological counterparts, contemporary artistic, societal and business ecosystems transcend the mere contingent. They have opened the term up to forms of organization that transcend spatio-temporal constraints. Ecosystems are no longer bound to a contiguous territory, but can be dispersed over space and time.

It is not by accident that this shift in meaning happened parallel to the rise and subsequent shattering of the internet. The last few decades has seen an explosion of possibilities to create networks, ventures, and communities that are distributed and asynchronous. 

But this dispersion also made it clear that healthy non-natural ecosystems do not just organically come into fruition and thrive. They do need to be designed and groomed, but in an unforced, open-ended manner.

This is the first in a series of articles in which I will develop a new practice called [ecosystem architecture](/series/ecosystem-architecture). Ecosystem architecture draws its inspiration from many sources: philosophy, gender studies, coding, spirituality, music, dance, visual arts, media theory to name a few. While this mix may seem eclectic or even erratic, there is actually reason to the madness. Natural ecosystems thrive on biodiversity and so do their conceptual antipodes. In order to tackle the challenges ahead of us, no single discipline or practice possesses all the knowledge and wisdom needed. And since ecosystems are wild and eclectic, so are their theoretical underpinnings.
