excerpt: Ecosystem architecture can help reclaim the internet by designing
  spaces aligned with people's needs, preventing a surveillance capitalism
  future. It emphasizes diverse, inclusive, and ownership-based futures.
summary: The decentralized internet's promise of diverse spaces has been
  undermined by outsourcing responsibility to governments and corporations. We
  must reclaim it to prevent a future dominated by surveillance capitalism. True
  alignment starts with understanding people's needs and creating multiple
  possible futures rather than settling for inevitable ones. Ecosystem
  architecture can help design and nurture such inclusive spaces.

# Reclaiming the Future

Ecosystem architecture encourages us to invest in futures that we would like to inhabit rather than settling for the one that we expect to become reality. From its inception, the true promise of the decentralized internet has been the multiplication of public and private spaces. More importantly, we also acquired an unrivaled degree of ownership over them. We did not lose the internet due to fragmentation, but because we started outsourcing our responsibility to governments and corporations. It is high time to reclaim it.

While the internet is irrecoverably shattered, I sincerely believe that it is still possible to prevent the tectonic plates from further drifting apart. However, I also acknowledge that the odds are rapidly stacking against us. Without fast and clear interventions, we will be destined for a future that is already being written for us. The name of that story is *Surveillance Capitalism*. In her book with the same title, Shoshana Zuboff succinctly captures its essence in one sentence:

 > 
 > Surveillance capitalism unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data.

― Shoshana Zuboff

Just like the proponents of the OG internet, corporations and governments capitalism also strives to connect the unconnected, since persistent online access helps them to gather larger amounts and more granular data. In the age of surveillance capitalism, these former adversaries have found a shared interest in getting more control over people's behavior. Data is the weapon of choice to achieve it. By analyzing large amounts of behavioral patterns, it becomes easier to predict and preempt people's actions. Naively giving people more and better access to the internet is only going to feed into this vicious cycle.

In order to prevent this future, it is thus important to first align the misaligned before we start connecting the unconnected. Alignment, however, does not start with asking people what they want. Alignment is the process of figuring out what people need, and then shaping one or many tangible futures out of these needs. Without a proper palette of possible alternatives, people will only repeat the most probable one. And the most probable narrative is always the one that fortifies the current status quo.

Whether it is cryptocurrencies, virtual and augmented reality, or artificial intelligence, loud alarm bells should go off whenever we are presented with a clear unavoidable future. In these instances, it is important to always ask the follows question: who is presenting this future? How is this person, network, or organization situated? And what interest do they in the realization of this future? 

These questions are not only important for present futures. They are equally applicable to past ones. In 'Further Considerations on Afrofuturism', Kodwo Eshun make a strong case for the importance of reading these so-called counter-futures.

 > 
 > By creating temporal complications and anachronistic episodes that disturb the linear time of progress, these futurisms adjust the temporal logics that condemned black subjects to prehistory. Chronopolitically speaking, these revisionist histories may be understood as a series of powerful competing futures that infiltrate the present at different rates.

— Kodwo Eshun

Past futurists are our future allies. They can teach us to reject the logic of a future that has already been written for us. The only way to avoid bleak dystopian scenarios, is to keep imagining, shaping, and performing better alternatives. What distinguishes our current reality, is that we no longer need to settle for an all-size-fits-all model of the future. Multiple inhabitable ecosystems based on shared values can peacefully coexists. These spaces, however, will not appear out of nowhere. They need to be designed, developed, and nurtured. Ecosystem architecture is the practice that does exactly that.
