    summary: The history of virtual space parallels physical space's fragmentation,
      leaving the internet shattered and irreparable. Mining and extraction
      drive the tech industry, causing environmental and social damages.

      design, offers a new approach to harnessing the fragmented internet,
      turning waste into innovation. It emphasizes the importance of designing
      biodiverse conceptual ecosystems that thrive through interdisciplinary
      collaboration for a regenerative future.
    excerpt: Ecosystem architecture reimagines the fragmented internet, drawing on
      interdisciplinary knowledge and regenerative design to transform waste
      into innovation and foster vibrant, decentralized ecosystems.
