  faq:
    title: Frequently Asked Questions
    items:
      - question: What exactly is a Black Ocean market?
        answer: A Black Ocean market is an entirely new market space that doesn't just
          meet existing demand, but creates new demand. Unlike Blue Ocean
          markets which are untapped but somewhat defined, Black Ocean markets
          are so novel that the rules and boundaries are yet to be established.
      - question: How is Ecosystem Architecture different from traditional business
          strategy?
        answer: Ecosystem Architecture goes beyond traditional business strategy by
          considering not just your organization, but the entire network of
          partners, customers, and even competitors. It focuses on creating
          shared value and fostering collaboration to tackle complex challenges
          and opportunities that no single organization could address alone.
      - question: Is this approach only for large corporations?
        answer: Not at all! Ecosystem Architecture can benefit organizations of all
          sizes. In fact, startups and SMEs often have an advantage in adopting
          this approach due to their agility and ability to pivot quickly.
