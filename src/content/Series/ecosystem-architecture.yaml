summary: The Ecosystem Architecture series explores the crossover between
  natural and metaphorical ecosystems in modern human organizations. It delves
  into how the concept of ecosystems, originally confined to specific spaces and
  times, now represents human organizations that break free from these
  limitations. The series discusses the preference for less hierarchical, more
  organic forms of organizations and introduces the practice of ecosystem
  architecture, inspired by various disciplines to design and sustain these
  entities.
excerpt: The term ecosystem has evolved beyond its biological origins to
  describe modern human organizations that transcend spatio-temporal
  constraints, reflecting a shift towards less hierarchical structures.
