summary: The series 'Ecosystem Architecture' explores the concept of ecosystems,
  both in their traditional sense involving biotic and abiotic interplay within
  a geographic space and time, and in their modern sense applied to
  decentralized human organizations. These contemporary ecosystems, which span
  across space and time, require new conceptual models and skills to understand
  and navigate. This exploration is termed Ecosystem Architecture.
excerpt: Ecosystems traditionally involve biotic and abiotic interactions within
  a geographic space and time. Modern usage transcends this, describing
  decentralized human organizations needing new models.
