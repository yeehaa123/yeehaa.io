summary: The Ecosystem Architecture series explores the evolution of the
  'ecosystem' concept from a biological community bound by space and time to a
  broader metaphor for decentralized, non-hierarchical structures in various
  fields. It advocates for new practices to build decentralized organizations
  that transcend traditional frameworks.
excerpt: Ecosystem describes a biological community bound by space and time. Its

  Architecture emerges as a new practice to cultivate thriving, dispersed
  organizations.
