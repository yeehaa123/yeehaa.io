summary: The Ecosystem Architecture series explores the metaphorical extension
  of biological ecosystem concepts to human organizations, reflecting a shift
  towards non-hierarchical, organic structures. This includes examining how
  these structures transcend geographic boundaries and timeframes, enabled by
  the internet, and presents the necessity for new conceptual models to
  effectively design and foster these contemporary ecosystems.
excerpt: Ecosystems signify a move to non-hierarchical structures. They
  transcend geography and require new models like Ecosystem Architecture to
  thrive.
