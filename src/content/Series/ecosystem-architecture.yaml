summary: Ecosystem Architecture explores the evolution of ecosystems from
  biological to digital realms. It examines how the concept has expanded to
  describe non-natural organizations, reflecting a shift towards decentralized

  systems. It argues for embracing this fragmentation as an opportunity for
  innovation and diversity.
