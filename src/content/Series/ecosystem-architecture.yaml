summary: The 'Ecosystem Architecture' series explores the evolution of the
  ecosystem concept from its biological origins to its application in
  organizational structures. It examines how ecosystems, once confined to
  specific spaces and times in nature, now describe diverse, decentralized
  networks across various domains. The series delves into the principles of
  ecosystem architecture, drawing from multiple disciplines to address the need
  for resilient, adaptive organizations in our interconnected world.
excerpt: Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term
  'ecosystem' has been broadened to describe non-natural organizations,
  underscoring a shift towards organic, decentralized structures.
