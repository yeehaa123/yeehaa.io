# Ecosystem Builder

## Problem

Ecosystems often fall short in delivering the innovation they promise, due to a lack of trust among participants. Contrary to popular belief, money and technology alone cannot solve this problem.

## Solution

We are a studio that designs, develops, and deploys solutions that align stakeholders into high-trust ecosystems so that they can collectively conquerÂ [black ocean](../../Notes/Black%20Ocean%20Strategy.md) markets.

## Principles

---

### Continuous JIT Learning

* We define ourselves as learning institution and communicate this upfront to prospects and recruits
* We document and publish all our learnings, both individually and collectively
* We invest in and utilize our own learning platform (Offcourse Next)

### Do Not Reinvent the Wheel

* Fully leverage ready-to-use software solutions (SAAS, BAAS, PAAS) 
* Avoid bespoke development work as much as possible
* Make use of Generative A.I. to both write and check our code
* We invest in and utilize our own infrastructure layer that allows us to quickly spin up new projects

---

### Maximize Ownership
