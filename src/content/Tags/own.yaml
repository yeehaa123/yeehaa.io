  associated with keeping the web weird, diverse, and innovative. This idea
  encourages individuals to take control of their digital presence, support
  open-source initiatives, and champion unconventional approaches to technology.
  It aligns with principles of individuality, creativity, and maintaining the
  internet as a dynamic, quirky space that resists conformity and nurtures
  unique expressions. The own philosophy promotes engagement with organizations
  like ISOC, embracing DIY culture, and exploring digital fabrication, all while
  advocating for personal data control and independent content creation.
