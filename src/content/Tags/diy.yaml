summary: DIY embodies the spirit of hands-on creativity and self-reliance. It
  encourages individuals to create, modify, and repair things independently. In
  the digital realm, it extends to web development, open-source projects, and
  digital fabrication. DIY culture promotes innovation, resourcefulness, and a
  sense of empowerment. It spans various domains, from home improvement to
  technology, fostering a community of makers and problem-solvers who value
  personal expression and customization over mass-produced solutions.
excerpt: Keep the web weird by engaging with ISOC, embracing open-source
  principles, exploring digital fabrication, channeling your inner guerrilla
  filmmaker, and championing digital ownership. These steps promote innovation
  and unconventional thinking.
