summary: The future tag explores the evolving concept of ecosystems, which
  traditionally are defined by space and time in biology, but now extend to
  decentralized, non-hierarchical structures beyond geographic boundaries in
  modern contexts. Through the lens of decentralization and regenerative
  practices, it aims to inspire innovative practices in various fields,
  proposing a new approach called ecosystem architecture.

  non-hierarchical structures inspired by diverse disciplines.
