summary: Dive into the concept of ecosystems, both in biological terms and as a
  metaphor for human organizations. Traditionally bound by space and time,
  ecosystems now describe evolving organizational structures that transcend
  these limits. This shift is driven by the desire for more organic and less
  hierarchical frameworks. Topics include ecosystem architecture, drawing from
  various disciplines to sustain these advanced systems.
excerpt: The term ecosystem has evolved beyond its biological origins to
  describe modern human organizations that transcend spatio-temporal
  constraints, reflecting a shift towards less hierarchical structures.
