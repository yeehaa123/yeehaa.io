summary: Ecosystem encompasses natural and non-natural systems characterized by
  interconnectedness and organic structures. It spans biological environments
  confined to space and time, as well as organizational frameworks that adopt
  decentralized, resilient architectures. This concept has evolved to address
  global challenges, emphasizing regenerative design, sustainability, and
  continuous collaborative innovation. Ecosystem thinking promotes a shift from
  hierarchical models to more adaptive, interconnected systems that can thrive
  across various domains and timescales.
excerpt: Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term has
  broadened to describe non-natural organizations, underscoring a shift towards
  organic, decentralized structures that promote resilience and sustainability.
