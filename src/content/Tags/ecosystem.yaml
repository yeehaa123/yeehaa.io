summary: Ecosystem encompasses both biological communities and modern,
  decentralized structures. Originally denoting organisms and their
  environments, the term now extends across disciplines and geographies,
  fostering new, non-hierarchical frameworks. It promotes the concept of
  Ecosystem Architecture, which encourages decentralized and thriving
  organizations beyond traditional boundaries.
excerpt: Ecosystem describes a biological community bound by space and time. Its
  metaphorical use signifies a shift towards decentralized structures. Ecosystem
  Architecture emerges as a new practice to cultivate thriving, dispersed
  organizations.
