summary: Ecosystem, as explored in these resources, extends beyond its
  biological origins to encompass diverse organizational structures. It
  represents a shift towards decentralized, organic, and interconnected systems
  that can thrive across space and time. This concept is applied to innovation
  practices, emphasizing regenerative design principles that aim to rejuvenate
  both society and the planet. The ecosystem approach advocates for sustainable,
  resilient architectures that can address global challenges through continuous
  collaborative efforts, moving beyond mere sustainability to focus on renewal
  and adaptability in various contexts.
excerpt: Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term has
  been broadened to describe non-natural organizations, underscoring a shift
  towards organic, decentralized structures that can address global challenges
  through collaborative innovation.
