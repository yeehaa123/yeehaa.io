summary: The concept of 'media' encompasses how communication technologies shape
  human experiences and societies. Marshall McLuhan's idea of a global village
  illustrates this by eroding local-global distinctions and intensifying
  tribalism. Modern media serves as a battleground for control over
  communication and power, with examples like Cambridge Analytica and deep fakes
  highlighting the pervasiveness and complexity of this issue.
