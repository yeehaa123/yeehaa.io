summary: The concept of power within the context of media and the global village
  is complex, highlighting both unifying and divisive aspects. Marshall
  McLuhanâ€™s vision of a 'global village' due to electric technology blurs
  local-global lines, fostering both unity and tribalism. The internet
  underscores this duality, serving as a battleground for control over
  communication and ideas. Media distractions mask deeper power struggles,
  extending beyond content to infrastructure, as illustrated by instances like
  Cambridge Analytica and the rise of deep fakes.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would create a 'global
  village,' eroding local-global distinctions while intensifying tribalism. The
  internet is now a battleground for communication control.
