summary: Power underscores the dynamics of control and influence within the
  modern global landscape. The interconnectedness of cultures, fueled by
  technology, serves as both a unifying force and a source of conflict and
  tribalism. Media becomes a tool for both distraction and deeper struggles for
  control. Understanding power requires navigating complex relationships and
  valuing pluralism.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would create a global
  village, eroding local-global distinctions while intensifying tribalism. The
  internet is now a battleground for communication control.
