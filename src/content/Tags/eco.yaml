summary: Eco represents a holistic approach to digital ecosystems, exploring the
  interconnectedness of technology, nature, and human interaction. It delves
  into concepts like ecosystem architecture, viewing digital landscapes as
  complex systems akin to natural environments. This perspective embraces the
  fragmentation of the internet as an opportunity for innovation and diversity,
  rather than a problem to be solved. Eco encourages a nuanced understanding of
  digital spaces, their evolution, and their impact on society and the
  environment.
excerpt: The internet has fragmented like tectonic shifts, mimicking physical
