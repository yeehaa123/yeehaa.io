summary: Decentral refers to the shift towards decentralized, non-hierarchical
  structures in various fields. The concept borrowed from biology's term
  'ecosystem,' transcends geographical boundaries, allowing for flourishing
  contemporary ecosystems. It emphasizes Ecosystem Architectureâ€”a practice
  inspired by multiple disciplines to foster thriving, decentralized
  organizations beyond traditional frameworks.
excerpt: Ecosystem describes a biological community bound by space and time. Its
