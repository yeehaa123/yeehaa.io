summary: Tribes encapsulates the idea of intensified cultural and social
  groupings within a broader, interconnected world. The term illustrates how
  global interconnectedness leads to heightened cultural clashes and tribalism,
  particularly in online environments. It examines the duality of unity and
  conflict, showing how modern technology both connects and divides. The ongoing
  battle over media control, as exemplified by controversies like Cambridge
  Analytica and deep fakes, highlights the complexity of our digital age.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would create a global
  village, eroding local-global distinctions while intensifying tribalism. The
  internet is now a battleground for communication control.
