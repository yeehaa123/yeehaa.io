summary: The concept of 'tribes' in this context refers to the intensification
  of tribalism due to modern technology and media. Marshall McLuhan's idea of
  the 'global village' suggests that while technology unifies the world by
  eroding local-global distinctions, it also exacerbates cultural clashes and
  struggles for control over communication. The internet today exemplifies this,
  becoming a battleground for ideological dominance, as evidenced by instances
  like Cambridge Analytica and deep fakes.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would create a 'global
  village,' eroding local-global distinctions while intensifying tribalism. The
  internet is now a battleground for communication control.
