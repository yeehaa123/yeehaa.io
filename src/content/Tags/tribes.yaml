summary: The term relates to how modern technology and media impact cultures and
  societies. Marshall McLuhan's idea of a 'global village' suggests that while
  technology fosters unity, it also intensifies tribalism and cultural
  conflicts, evidenced by internet struggles over communication control and idea
  propagation. Examples like Cambridge Analytica and deep fakes highlight these
  media wars, emphasizing the need for navigating complex relationships and
  valuing pluralism.
excerpt: Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would create a 'global
