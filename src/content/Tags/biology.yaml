summary: Biology encompasses the study of life in its myriad forms, systems, and
  processes. This overview delves into contemporary applications of biological
  concepts extending beyond traditional bounds to include dynamic human
  organizations and ecosystems. The focus is on innovative models like Ecosystem
  Architecture, which emphasize non-hierarchical, interconnected frameworks akin
  to natural systems. The concept also spans diverse and asynchronous networks,
  underscoring the evolution towards more organic, adaptable structures.
excerpt: Ecosystems signify a move to non-hierarchical structures. They
  transcend geography and require new models like Ecosystem Architecture to
  thrive.
