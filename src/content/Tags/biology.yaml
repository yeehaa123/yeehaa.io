summary: The biology category encompasses resources that explore living systems,
  from traditional ecosystems to metaphorical uses in human organizations. It
  includes interdisciplinary approaches for understanding and designing complex,
  adaptive systems.
excerpt: The term 'ecosystem' has evolved beyond its biological origins to
  describe modern human organizations that transcend spatio-temporal
  constraints, reflecting a shift towards less hierarchical structures.
