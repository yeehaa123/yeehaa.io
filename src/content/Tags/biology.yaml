summary: Biology encompasses the study of life and organisms in various
  ecosystems defined by unique biotic and abiotic factors. The concept of an
  ecosystem has evolved to include non-natural organizations, reflecting a trend
  towards decentralized and resilient structures. This holistic approach
  integrates principles from multiple disciplines to foster organic networks
  that thrive across different spatial and temporal scales.
excerpt: Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term
  ecosystem has been broadened to describe non-natural organizations,
  underscoring a shift towards organic, decentralized structures.
