summary: Crypto refers to decentralized organizations and structures that
  transcend traditional geographic and hierarchical boundaries, driven by the
  internet. The concept is often likened to biological ecosystems, emphasizing
  non-hierarchical, thriving communities that require innovative models and
  tools for effective management.

  specific area. Its overuse in other contexts reflects a desire for less
  hierarchical structures. Modern ecosystems transcend space-time.
