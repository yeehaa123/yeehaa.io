summary: The nature category encompasses resources related to the intricate
  balance of biological ecosystems and their unique biotic and abiotic factors.
  These ecosystems, defined by their specific space and time, can also describe
  modern, decentralized organizational structures. This interdisciplinary
  approach emphasizes resilience and organic growth.
excerpt: Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term
  ecosystem has been broadened to describe non-natural organizations,
  underscoring a shift towards organic, decentralized structures.
