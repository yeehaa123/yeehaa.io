summary: Plants represent growth, nurturing, and the creation of beauty in both
  literal and metaphorical senses. This concept is explored in the course "Groom
  Your Ecosystem," which uses plant-related imagery to discuss personal and
  professional development. The course emphasizes the importance of cultivating
  a diverse, purposeful, and dynamic environment, much like tending to a garden.
  It encourages individuals to lead with purpose, develop polyglot skills, bring
  innovation, and create beauty in their personal and professional lives.
