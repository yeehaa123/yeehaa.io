summary: The concept waste explores the cultural and ideological implications of
  recontextualizing materials often considered garbage. Key themes include the
  distortion of decentralization through the rise of the crypto market, and the
  transformative practice of artists who blend nature and culture to challenge
  traditional notions of scarcity and abundance.
excerpt: Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille explore how the crypto market
  deviated from its potential, emphasizing excess and abundance. Shraddha
