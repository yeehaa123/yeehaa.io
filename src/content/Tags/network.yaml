summary: Network represents interconnected systems and structures, both in
  nature and human-made contexts. It explores the relationships and interactions
  between various elements, emphasizing decentralized and organic organizational
  models. This concept draws from biological ecosystems, which are bound by
  specific spatial and temporal factors, and applies these principles to
  non-natural settings. The network approach highlights the shift towards more
  flexible, resilient, and adaptive structures in various fields, including
  organizational design and ecosystem architecture. It encompasses ideas from
  multiple disciplines to address the complexities of modern systems across
  space and time.
excerpt: Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term
  'ecosystem' has been broadened to describe non-natural organizations,
  underscoring a shift towards organic, decentralized structures.
