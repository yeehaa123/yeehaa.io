summary: The term 'society' encompasses diverse human organizations, systems,
  and structures that evolve over time. It includes ecosystems that transcend
  traditional hierarchies, especially with the advent of the internet, promoting
  decentralized networks that are more fluid and interconnected. This shift
  encourages innovative ways of thinking about and cultivating organizational
  and social structures across spatial and temporal boundaries.
excerpt: Ecosystem has evolved from a biological term to describe human
  organizations that transcend traditional boundaries, fostering distributed and
  asynchronous networks.
