summary: Zeitgeist explores the spirit of the times, capturing the cultural,
  intellectual, and political climate of a particular era. It often intersects
  with trends in biology, decentralized systems, and the internet. Modern
  zeitgeist transcends traditional boundaries and emphasizes the move towards
  less hierarchical structures, driven by advancements in technology and new
  organizational models.
