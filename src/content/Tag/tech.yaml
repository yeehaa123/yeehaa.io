summary: Tech serves as a multifaceted lens through which to explore the
  contemporary landscape of digital innovation, fragmentation, and
  decentralization. It encompasses everything from the critique of the tech
  industryâ€™s exploitative practices, as mirrored in internet fragmentation, to
  discussions on the cultural shifts prompted by the rise of cryptocurrencies
  and decentralizing technologies. Whether through exploratory articles or
  individual profiles, tech provides a robust framework for analyzing current
  and future digital ecosystems.
excerpt: Fragmentation of the internet mirrors Earth's tectonic shifts and
