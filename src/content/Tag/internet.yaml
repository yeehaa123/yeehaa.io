summary: The Internet symbolizes both connection and fragmentation within the
  digital world. From global variations in internet experience to the emergence
  of decentralized, sustainable 'ecosystem architectures,' discussions cover
  technical, governmental, and commercial divides. Narratives critique the
  nostalgia for the early internet while pushing for a realistic view of its
  evolution and potential. Highlighting efforts for inclusivity and innovation,
  the Internet stands as a dynamic space of both challenges and opportunities.
excerpt: Fragmentation of the internet mirrors Earth's tectonic shifts and
  exploitative tech practices. Embracing fragmented systems, 'ecosystem
  architecture' aims for creating vibrant, sustainable digital ecosystems.
