  bio: >
    
    I am an entrepreneur, thinker, and coder. Nowadays, I like to call myself an
    ecosystem architect. Concretely, this means that I bring people together
    around common values, discover a shared vision, and translate this into
    effective ecosystems.


    My greatest passion has always been changing the way people learn, and
    challenging preconceived and ill-informed notions of educational
    institutions. With Offcourse, I aim to create an ecosystem of people and
    tools that focus on open and transparent knowledge sharing instead of
    credentials, ego, and intellectual property.


    In 2021, I created the Superconnectors event format that enabled startups to
    present their so-called 'critical ask' to the best-connected people of the
    Dutch tech ecosystem. 


    I holds a PhD in Philosophy from the university of Utrecht and worked as a
    researcher and teacher at several traditional (Utrecht, Berlin, Amsterdam,
    Minneapolis) and non-traditional (DevBootcamp San Francisco) schools. I also
    founded the Innovator's Working Group of the Dutch Internet Society, and was
    actively involved in the Public Spaces Coalition. I strongly advocate for
    impactful and inclusive internet.


    I currently work and live in Taipei, Taiwan.
