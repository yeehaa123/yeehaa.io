Also add ${min_num_tags} to ${max_num_tags} tags. A single tags is a single-word, simple, non-hyphenated and are associated to a href? Only include tags that are really important. Again, only give me the answer. No extra words. Tags can have no more than ${tag_length} characters, are not composed of multiple words and can thus not contain a hyphen, and are all lowercase.

    Additional, add a ${excerpt_length} characters excerpt of the article.`
