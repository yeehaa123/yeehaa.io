${JSON.stringify(articles, null, 2)}

Please summarize the series for me in a maximum of ${summary_length} characters. Dont use quotation marks

Also add ${min_num_tags} to ${max_num_tags} tags.A single tags is a single - word, simple, non - hyphenated and are associated to a href ? Only include tags that are really important.Again, only give me the answer.No extra words.Tags can have no more than ${tag_length} characters, are not composed of multiple words and can thus not contain a hyphen, and are all lowercase.

  Additional, add a ${excerpt_length} characters excerpt of the article.`
