  "summary": "An ecosystem, traditionally a biological concept tied to specific geographic areas, has seen its metaphorical use expand to describe human organizations. This shift reflects a desire for less mechanical and more organic structures not bound by time or space, emphasizing interconnected, distributed networks and communities.
