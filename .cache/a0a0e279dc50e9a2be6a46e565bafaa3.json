  "summary": "Biological ecosystems are limited to specific spaces and times but their concept has been extended in modern usage to describe complex, decentralized, and non-hierarchical human organizations. This shift is reflective of a societal desire for less structured and more organic forms of organization. Current human ecosystems transcend geographical boundaries, spurred by the internet, and require new conceptual models and skillsâ€”what the author terms 'Ecosystem Architecture.' This involves interdisciplinary inspiration and aims to create thriving, resilient systems beyond traditional frameworks.",
  "excerpt": "The article explores how the term 'ecosystem' has evolved beyond its biological roots to describe decentralized and non-hierarchical human organizations, emphasizing the need for new models and skills.",
