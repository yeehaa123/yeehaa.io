  "summary": "The article, \"Economy of Garbage,\" explores the concept of decentralization and its impact on society, particularly through the lens of cultural and economic excess. It discusses the rise and fall of the crypto market, likening it to the 1990s' overly optimistic beliefs in capitalism and liberalism. The text delves into Walter Benjamin’s and Georges Bataille’s theories on scarcity and excess, arguing that modern capitalism's reliance on overproduction leads to waste. Bataille’s idea of an 'economy of excess' is presented as an alternative that values waste as a natural and integral part of human experience. Contemporary artist Shraddha Borawake's work, which integrates waste into art and challenges traditional dichotomies of nature and culture, is highlighted as an embodiment of Bataille’s vision.",
