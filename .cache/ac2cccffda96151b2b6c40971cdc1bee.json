  "summary": "The term ecosystem, originally from biology referring to community interactions within specific geographical and temporal limits, now describes human organizations with less hierarchical structures. Unlike natural ecosystems, these modern counterparts spread across space and time, necessitating intentional design and cultivation. Interdisciplinary approaches, termed 'ecosystem architecture,' aim to explore and develop this concept.",
  "excerpt": "Human organizations aspire to function less hierarchically, leading to the broadened use of ecosystem. These ecosystems, not bound by geography, need intentional design for thriving."
