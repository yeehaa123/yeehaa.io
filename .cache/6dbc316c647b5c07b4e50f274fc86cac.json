  "summary": "The article discusses the fragmentation of the internet and the corresponding need to rethink how we interact with these fragments. It introduces the concept of 'ecosystem architecture,' inspired by biology's ecosystems but extending to contemporary artistic, societal, and business contexts. The author argues that, unlike natural ecosystems, human-designed ecosystems require intentional and open-ended nurturing. Drawing from varied disciplines, the article positions ecosystem architecture at the intersection of decentralization and regenerative design. Regenerative design aims not just for sustainability but for renewing and revitalizing systems. The fragmented internet, therefore, is seen as holding potential for a vibrant future rather than being a lost paradise.",
