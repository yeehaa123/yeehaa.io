  "summary": "Biology involves the study of ecosystems, which are defined by their biotic and abiotic interactions within specific spatial and temporal boundaries. Recently, the term has been extended to non-biological contexts to describe more organic and less mechanical structures. Advances in technology allow these ecosystems to transcend traditional boundaries, giving rise to the field of ecosystem architecture.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystems, initially biological and confined, have evolved to describe non-biological, dispersed organizations, reflecting a desire for less mechanical structures, needing careful design."
