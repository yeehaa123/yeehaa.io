  "summary": "Marshall McLuhan predicted that technology would turn the world into a global village, erasing distinctions between local and global cultures but also heightening clashes between different tribes. The internet, embodying McLuhan's vision, is a battleground where cultural, political, and religious factions vie for control over communication mediums, not just content. Friedrich Kittler contextualized media warfare as a struggle for control over transmission channels. Incidents like Cambridge Analytica and the rise of deep fakes exemplify this battle. The global village is marked by complex relationships and the futility of old dichotomies. Value pluralism is suggested as the pragmatic way forward.",
