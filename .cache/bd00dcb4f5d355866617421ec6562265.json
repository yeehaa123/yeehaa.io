  "summary": "An ecosystem in biology refers to a specific geographic area with a community of living organisms and their physical environment. Despite its roots in biology, the term has been overused metaphorically, especially in areas like cryptocurrency. This overuse, while often criticized, reflects a desire for less hierarchical organizations. Modern 'ecosystems' differ from biological ones as they transcend space and time, aided by the internet. The concept of 'ecosystem architecture' suggests careful yet open-ended design for thriving, non-natural ecosystems.",
