  "summary": "Decentralized ecosystems can be more vibrant and resilient than centralized ones, as people gain more control over resources and decisions. Regenerative design aims to improve environments sustainably. Key techniques include Permaculture and Biomimicry. Both approaches emphasize learning from nature through cooperation rather than competition, fostering healthier ecosystems and communities. Ultimately, sustainability and regeneration are achieved by collaborative alignment, not hierarchical control.",
