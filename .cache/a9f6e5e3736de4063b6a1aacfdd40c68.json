  "summary": "Ecosystem encompasses the transition of the term from a biologically-rooted concept to a metaphor used in modern human organizations. This reflects a shift towards less hierarchical and more organic structures. With its spatio-temporal transcendent qualities, ecosystem now serves as a framework for distributed, asynchronous networks, leading to the inception of 'ecosystem architecture,' which designs and nurtures complex systems by drawing from interdisciplinary sources.",
  "excerpt": "The term ecosystem now describes human organizations desiring less hierarchy and more organic structures, transcending spatio-temporal constraints. This led to ecosystem architecture to design such systems."
