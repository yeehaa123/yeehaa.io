  "summary": "Ecosystem is a versatile concept that extends beyond its biological origins. Initially describing confined natural systems with unique biotic and abiotic factors, it now encompasses non-natural organizations. This evolution reflects a shift towards more organic, decentralized structures in various fields. Ecosystem architecture draws from multiple disciplines to create resilient, thriving organizations that transcend traditional boundaries of space and time. This broader application demonstrates the concept's adaptability and relevance in understanding complex, interconnected systems across different domains.",
