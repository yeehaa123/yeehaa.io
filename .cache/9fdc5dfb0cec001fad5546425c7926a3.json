  "summary": "The 'Ecosystem Architecture' series delves into the evolution of the term 'ecosystem' from its biological origins to its modern metaphorical use in human organizations, reflecting a shift towards less hierarchical and more organic structures that transcend spatial and temporal boundaries. The term has become a framework for distributed, asynchronous networks, introducing 'ecosystem architecture' as a new approach to designing and nurturing these complex systems based on interdisciplinary sources.",
  "excerpt": "The term ecosystem now describes human organizations desiring less hierarchy and more organic structures, transcending spatio-temporal constraints. This led to ecosystem architecture to design such systems.",
