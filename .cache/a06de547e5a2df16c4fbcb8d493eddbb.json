  "summary": "The term 'coding' encompasses more than just the act of writing computer programs. It reaches into various domains like ecosystem architecture, where philosophy, art, and coding converge to form decentralized and regenerative networks. This synthesis aims to foster healthier, more vibrant ecosystems. Although traditionally seen as a purely technical skill, coding also has implications in designing sustainable, future-forward systems. The application of coding in these areas seeks to promote growth, renewal, and resilience.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem architecture draws from philosophy, coding, and the arts to create decentralized, vibrant ecosystems. Positioned between decentralization and regenerative design, it fosters renewal and growth."
