  "summary": "The term ecosystem in biology, referring to community interactions within specific geographical and temporal boundaries, has transcended its original meaning to describe human organizations in contemporary contexts. This shift reflects a desire for less hierarchical organizational structures. Unlike natural ecosystems, these contemporary ecosystems are dispersed over space and time, requiring intentional design and cultivation. 'Ecosystem architecture' seeks to explore this new paradigm through interdisciplinary approaches.",
  "excerpt": "Human organizations aspire to function less hierarchically, leading to the broadened use of 'ecosystem.' These ecosystems, not bound by geography, need intentional design for thriving.",
