  "summary": "The term ecosystem in biology, typically bound to specific geographic areas and timeframes, has been metaphorically stretched to describe human organizations. This shift reflects a desire for non-hierarchical, organic structures, extending beyond just geographic bounds to diverse and asynchronous networks enabled by the internet.
