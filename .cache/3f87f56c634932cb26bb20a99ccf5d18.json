  "summary": "This concept explores the intersection of space, time, and ecosystems, both in biological contexts and as metaphors for organizational structures. It delves into how ecosystems are confined by spatial and temporal factors, featuring unique biotic and abiotic elements. The idea has been extended beyond nature to describe non-natural organizations, reflecting a shift towards more organic, decentralized structures. This broader application draws from various disciplines to address the need for resilient, thriving organizations that can adapt across different spaces and times. The exploration of this concept offers insights into the interconnectedness of natural systems and their potential applications in organizational design and management.",
