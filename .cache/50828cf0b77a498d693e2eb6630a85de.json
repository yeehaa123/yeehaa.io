  "summary": "Ecosystems are biologically confined to specific spaces and times, characterized by biotic and abiotic factors. The metaphorical use of 'ecosystem' in human contexts hints at non-hierarchical, organic structures transcending traditional terms for human organizations. Contemporary ecosystems, with roots in internet evolution, require deliberate, interdisciplinary design, termed 'ecosystem architecture', fusing diverse fields for holistic growth.",
  "excerpt": "The term 'ecosystem', originally grounded in biology, now refers to dynamic, non-hierarchical human organizations that transcend space and time, requiring deliberate, interdisciplinary cultivation.",
