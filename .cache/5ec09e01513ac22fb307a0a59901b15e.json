  "summary": "Ecosystem architecture is a new practice merging philosophy, coding, and the arts to create healthy, non-natural ecosystems. Operating at the intersection of decentralization and regenerative design, it aims to build distributed, asynchronous networks, ventures, and communities. While decentralization drives economic progress but generates waste, regenerative design focuses on renewing ecosystems. Embracing Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, the practice fosters a promising future.",
