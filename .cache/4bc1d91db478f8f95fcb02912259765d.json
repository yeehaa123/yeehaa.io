  "summary": "The term 'ecosystem' in biology refers to the interactions between living organisms and their physical environments within a specific space and time. This concept has been overused in modern contexts, especially in technology and business, to describe organizations that transcend traditional spatial and temporal boundaries. The shift reflects a desire for more organic, less hierarchical structures. This new 'ecosystem architecture' requires purposeful design, drawing from diverse fields to foster healthy, distributed communities.",
  "excerpt": "The term 'ecosystem' once bound to biological context is now used to describe distributed, non-hierarchical human organizations, reflecting a shift in how we envisage collective structures.",
