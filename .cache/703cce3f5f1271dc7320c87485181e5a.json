  "summary": "Biology encompasses the study of living organisms and their interactions with the environment. The concept of an ecosystem, essential in biology, denotes a community of organisms within a specific area interacting with each other and their environment. This idea has been adapted in various non-literal contexts, such as crypto, to signify less hierarchical organizations. With the internet enabling interactions beyond geographic constraints, modern ecosystems now transcend time and space, requiring innovative models for sustainable, decentralized systems.",
  "excerpt": "An ecosystem in biology involves organisms interacting within a specific area. Its overuse in other contexts reflects a desire for less hierarchical structures. Modern ecosystems transcend space-time."
