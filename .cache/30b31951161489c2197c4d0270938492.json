  "summary": "The article discusses the concept of an ecosystem, both literal and metaphorical. Traditionally, ecosystems involve interactions among living organisms within a specific geographic space and time, influenced by biotic and abiotic factors. In modern usage, the term has transcended its origins, describing contemporary human organizations seeking organic, non-hierarchical structures. These new 'ecosystems' are dispersed across space and time and demand new conceptual models and skills, a practice termed Ecosystem Architecture.",
