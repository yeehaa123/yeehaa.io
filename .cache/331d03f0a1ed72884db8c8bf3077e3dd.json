  "summary": "The article 'Across Space And Time' explores the evolution of the term 'ecosystem' from its biological roots, confined to specific geographic and temporal boundaries, to its overused modern metaphorical use in various human organizations. This shift reflects a growing desire for organizations to function in a less hierarchical, more organic way. The term also transcends spatial and temporal limitations, becoming a framework for distributed, asynchronous networks. The article introduces 'ecosystem architecture,' a new approach to designing and nurturing these complex systems, drawing from various interdisciplinary sources.",
  "excerpt": "The term 'ecosystem' now describes human organizations desiring less hierarchy and more organic structures, transcending spatio-temporal constraints. This led to 'ecosystem architecture' to design such systems.",
