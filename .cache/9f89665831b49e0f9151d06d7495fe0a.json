In his work 'Foams,' he advocates for viewing fragmentation positively. This perspective is pertinent in the context of the internet, where filter bubbles create both opportunities for connection and risks of isolation and solipsism. Sloterdijk argues for fostering diverse ecosystems without reverting to universal norms.",
