  "summary": "Peter Sloterdijk's concept of 'foam' in his book 'Foams' (1998) defies traditional metaphors of unity and wholeness, celebrating multiplicity instead. The article criticizes the view of internet fragmentation as negative and argues for the term 'internet foaming.' It examines the role of filter bubbles, highlighting both their positive aspects (shared values, connections) and negative aspects (entrapment, solipsism). The challenge lies in addressing these issues without reverting to universal norms, accepting that every bubble's 'outside' is simply another bubble.",
