  "summary": "Peter Sloterdijk's 'Foams' from his Spheres trilogy challenges the conventional ideas of wholeness and celebrates multiplicity. The term 'foam' metaphorically captures the interconnected yet self-contained nature of societies and online ecosystems. The article critiques the negativity associated with internet fragmentation, arguing instead for the positive potential of 'internet foaming.' It explores the evolution from the dot-com bubble to modern filter bubbles, proposing that these are not entirely detrimental but can foster connectedness and solidarity. However, it warns against entrapment and solipsism within bubbles, advocating for awareness and fostering of ecosystems without reverting to universal norms.",
