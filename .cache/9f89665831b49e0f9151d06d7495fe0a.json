  "summary": "The article discusses the pervasive nature of conceptual metaphors implying wholeness and the difficulty of embracing fragmentation. Peter Sloterdijk's concept of 'foam' in his Spheres trilogy celebrates multiplicity rather than universality. The modern internet exemplifies this 'foaming,' from the dot-com bubble to filter bubbles. Rather than viewing fragmentation negatively, the article suggests embracing it to foster connectivity and ecosystem building, while addressing issues like entrapment and solipsism within bubbles.",

  "excerpt": "The article rethinks fragmentation, inspired by Peter Sloterdijk's 'foam.' Instead of lamenting wholeness lost, it sees multiplicity as empowering, proposing 'internet foaming' over 'fragmentation.'"
