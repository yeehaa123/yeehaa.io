  "summary": "The article explores the deeply ingrained conceptual metaphors of wholeness and fragmentation in everyday language and highlights Peter Sloterdijk's concept of 'foam' from his Spheres trilogy. Foam celebrates multiplicity and interconnectedness, unlike traditional metaphors of unity. The metaphor extends to internet phenomena like filter bubbles, emphasizing shared values and ecosystems rather than isolation. True understanding involves fostering these bubbles as ecosystems while avoiding entrapment and solipsism, and recognizing their interconnected nature.",
