  "summary": "Ecosystem architecture involves creating intentional, value-driven virtual communities rather than relying on traditional community formation. It adopts a bottom-up approach, focusing on emergent structures rather than pre-planned blueprints. Practitioners balance conformation to rules with innovation and playfulness. Cellular automata exemplify this, using simple rules to generate complex behaviors and creativity. The practice is divided into four stages: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out, emphasizing continuous alignment, validation, and eventual independence of the ecosystem.",
