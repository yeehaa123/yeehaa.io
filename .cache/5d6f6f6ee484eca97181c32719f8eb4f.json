  "summary": "Ecosystem architecture involves creating intentional communities through shared values, emphasizing decentralized, regenerative design. It forgoes traditional planning in favor of emergent structures, paralleling concepts of practice, conformation, and playfulness. Using examples like cellular automata, it explores how simple rule sets can generate complex, innovative systems. The practice follows a framework with stages: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out, fostering self-sustaining, thriving ecosystems.",
