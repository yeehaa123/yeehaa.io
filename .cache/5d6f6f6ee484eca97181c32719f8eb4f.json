  "summary": "Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing virtual spaces driven by shared values instead of traditional structures. It emphasizes decentralized, regenerative, bottom-up design, leading to emergent systems rather than controlled ones. Practitioners navigate between conformation and creativity, similar to artists and cellular automata. The process comprises four stages: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out, to eventually let the ecosystem thrive independently.",
