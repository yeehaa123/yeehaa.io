  "summary": "Ecosystem architecture is the practice of designing communities based on shared values rather than spatiotemporal contingency. This approach emphasizes decentralized, bottom-up development and values the interplay between structure and practice, fostering creativity and innovation. Unlike traditional controlled systems, ecosystems evolve organically, guided by rules that reflect underlying values. This practice is performed through four phases: Align, Validate, Scale, and Spin Out, aimed at creating self-sustaining, thriving ecosystems.",
