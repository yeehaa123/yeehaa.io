  "summary": "The article delves into the concept of decentralization, contrasting it with fragmentation, and explores the cultural and economic implications of an 'excess' mindset, particularly in the context of modern capitalism and blockchain technology. It reflects on the rise and fall of crypto as a modern iteration of 1990s beliefs in boundless capitalism and liberalism. The discussion transitions to Walter Benjamin's and Georges Bataille's ideas: Benjamin highlights how modernity eliminates scarcity, while Bataille advocates for embracing excess and waste. Shraddha Borawake's artistic practice, 'Garb-Age,' exemplifies this idea by blurring the lines between nature, culture, and trash, suggesting that waste is central to both.",
