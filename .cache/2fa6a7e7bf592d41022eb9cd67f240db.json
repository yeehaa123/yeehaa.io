  "summary": "The article 'Economy of Garbage' explores the concepts of decentralization, excess, and abundance, rooted in the cultural techniques of blockchain and crypto. It critiques the way society has shifted from valuing technological innovations for their potential to amass wealth quickly. Drawing insights from Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille, the article examines the interplay between material abundance and symbolic, non-utilitarian values. Through Shraddha Borawake's artistic practice, it argues that waste, rather than being discarded, should be integrated into our understanding of nature and culture.",
