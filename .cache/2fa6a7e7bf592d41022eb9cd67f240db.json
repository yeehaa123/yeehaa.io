  "summary": "The article delves into the distinction between decentralization and fragmentation, critiques the excess mindset prevalent in modern blockchain and crypto communities, and reflects on the historical fascination with capitalism's promise of limitless resources. By exploring the ideas of Walter Benjamin and Georges Bataille, it proposes an economy of excess where waste is embraced rather than shunned. Shraddha Borawake's practice, Garb-Age, exemplifies this by merging nature, culture, and trash, challenging the notions of purity and authenticity.",
