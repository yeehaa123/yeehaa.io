  "summary": "The Ecosystem Architecture series explores the concept of ecosystems in both biological and modern contexts, with a focus on decentralized organizations. It critiques the overextended use of the term 'ecosystem' outside its literal meaning, while advocating for less hierarchical and more thriving organizational structures. The series draws inspiration from various fields to propose new models and tools for modern, internet-driven ecosystems.",
