  "summary": "Ecosystem represents a concept that spans natural and organizational realms. It emphasizes interconnectedness, resilience, and organic structures. In biology, ecosystems are specific to time and space, with unique biotic and abiotic factors. However, the term has evolved to describe non-natural systems, reflecting a shift towards decentralized and adaptive organizational models. This broader application of ecosystem thinking is particularly relevant in innovation and design, where it's used to address global challenges through sustainable, regenerative approaches. The ecosystem concept encourages a holistic view of systems, promoting balance, renewal, and collaborative practices across various domains.",
  "excerpt": "Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term has broadened to describe non-natural organizations, underscoring a shift towards organic, decentralized structures. Innovation should enhance the planet and society through regenerative design."
