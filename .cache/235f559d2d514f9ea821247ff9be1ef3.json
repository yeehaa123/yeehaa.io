  "summary": "Ecosystem encompasses both natural and organizational systems, emphasizing interconnectedness and resilience. It explores biological ecosystems confined by space and time, and extends to non-natural structures that adopt decentralized, organic approaches. This concept is applied to innovation and design, advocating for regenerative practices that rejuvenate the planet and society. By drawing from diverse disciplines, ecosystem architecture aims to create sustainable, thriving, and adaptable systems that can address global challenges across various domains.",
  "excerpt": "Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term has broadened to describe non-natural organizations. Innovation should enhance the planet and society through decentralized, regenerative design, creating resilient, interconnected ecosystems."
