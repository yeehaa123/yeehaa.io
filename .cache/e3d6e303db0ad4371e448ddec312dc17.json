  "summary": "The article explores the evolution of the term 'ecosystem' from its biological roots, describing a space where organisms interact within specific spatio-temporal boundaries, to its metaphorical use in human organizations such as cryptocurrencies and businesses. The piece argues for a broader, less bounded interpretation of ecosystems that can transcend space and time. It introduces 'ecosystem architecture,' a new practice that draws from diverse fields to design human ecosystems that thrive beyond traditional constraints.",
  "excerpt": "The term 'ecosystem' has evolved beyond biology to describe dynamic, non-bounded human organizations, transcending space and time. Introduction to 'ecosystem architecture,' a multidisciplinary practice.",
