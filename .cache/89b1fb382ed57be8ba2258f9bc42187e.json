  "description": "The concept of ecosystems in biology, confined to space and time, has evolved metaphorically to describe decentralized and temporal organizations beyond geographic boundaries. These modern ecosystems emphasize non-hierarchical structures, reflecting a shift in organizational expectations. To create thriving ecosystems, a new practice called ecosystem architecture is proposed, drawing inspiration from diverse fields. This series will examine how decentralization and regenerative practices can foster innovative ecosystems.",
