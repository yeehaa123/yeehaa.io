  "summary": "The article discusses the concept of internet fragmentation, noting that the 'normal' internet experience differs significantly worldwide. In Asia, superapps dominate web interaction, while Africa uses mesh and P2P networks for internet access. The Global North has a more conventional web experience. Internet fragmentation is classified into three types: technical, governmental, and commercial. Organizations like the Internet Society work to address these issues and promote a globally accessible internet. The article critiques the romanticized notion of the early internet (OG Internet) and argues that it never truly fulfilled its promise of fostering universal consensus and understanding. Instead, it led to increased propaganda and identity politics.",
