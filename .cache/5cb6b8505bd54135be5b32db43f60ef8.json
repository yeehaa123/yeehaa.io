  "summary": "The article discusses the concept of \"voting with your feet\" within ecosystems, highlighting how organisms migrate to more favorable conditions. This principle is applied to human and digital ecosystems, emphasizing the necessity of freedom of movement for creativity, innovation, and escaping entrapment. The article critiques the idea of universal values within the internet, arguing for value pluralism and decentralized digital communities. It explores the notion of network states, as proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, which operate on shared values rather than physical space. These startup societies iterate and validate ethical propositions, aiming for diplomatic recognition.
