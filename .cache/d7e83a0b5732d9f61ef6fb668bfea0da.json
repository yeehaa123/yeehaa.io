  "summary": "The term ecosystem in biology refers to communities of organisms and their interactions within an environment over space and time. The concept has broadened to include decentralized, non-hierarchical systems in various fields. Ecosystem Architecture is proposed as a new methodology for developing decentralized organizations inspired by principles from multiple disciplines. The resources under the Biology category explore these ideas, encouraging innovative approaches to understanding and building ecosystems within and beyond biological contexts.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystem describes a biological community bound by space and time. Its metaphorical use signifies a shift towards decentralized structures. Ecosystem Architecture emerges as a new practice to cultivate thriving, dispersed organizations."
