  "summary": "Ecosystems are complex networks of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. This encompasses various habitats, from forests and oceans to deserts and tundras. Understanding ecosystems is crucial for biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and addressing global challenges like climate change. It involves studying energy flow, nutrient cycling, and species interactions. Ecosystems provide essential services such as food production, water purification, and climate regulation. Human activities significantly impact these delicate balances, making ecosystem research vital for sustainable development and environmental preservation.",
