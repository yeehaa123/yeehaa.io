  "summary": "The term ecology refers to the complex web of interactions between living organisms and their physical environment. Although often applied metaphorically in popular culture to describe human organizations, it truly encompasses the scientific study of these interdependencies. The 'ecology' resources examine how organisms coexist, compete, and thrive within shared environments, providing insights applicable to both natural and artificial systems.",
  "excerpt": "The term ecosystem has been overused to describe various organizations, but this reflects a shift towards organic, non-hierarchical structures. Contemporary ecosystems transcend physical boundaries, needing new conceptual models to thrive."
