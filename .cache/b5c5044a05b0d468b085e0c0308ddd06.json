  "summary": "In biology, ecosystems are geographically and temporally confined, characterized by biotic and abiotic factors' interactions. The term 'ecosystem' has been widely adapted in non-bioligical contexts despite some backlash; its overuse reflects a shift in how people view organizations, desiring less mechanical, more organic structures. Contemporary ecosystems transcend spatio-temporal boundaries due to technological advances but need careful, open-ended design, giving rise to the discipline of ecosystem architecture, inspired by diverse fields.",
  "excerpt": "Ecosystems, initially biological and confined, have evolved to describe non-biological, dispersed organizations, reflecting a desire for less mechanical structures, needing careful design.",
