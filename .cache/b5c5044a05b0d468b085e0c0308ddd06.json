  "summary": "The article discusses the concept of ecosystems both in biological terms and metaphorically in human organizations. While ecosystems in nature are confined to specific spaces and times, the term has evolved to describe modern human organizations that transcend spatio-temporal constraints. The author suggests that the increased use of 'ecosystem' reflects a desire for less hierarchical, more organic forms of organization. The new practice of 'ecosystem architecture' is introduced, drawing inspiration from various disciplines to design and sustain these non-natural ecosystems.",
