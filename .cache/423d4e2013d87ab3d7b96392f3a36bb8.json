  "summary": "Biology encompasses the study of life and living organisms. This interdisciplinary field explores ecosystems, which are confined to specific spaces and times, featuring unique biotic and abiotic factors. The concept of ecosystems has expanded beyond natural environments to describe organizational structures, reflecting a shift towards more organic, decentralized systems. This broader application draws from various disciplines to address the need for resilient and thriving organizations across different contexts. Biology's principles continue to inspire innovations in fields like ecosystem architecture, demonstrating its relevance beyond traditional scientific boundaries.",
  "excerpt": "Biological ecosystems are specific to space and time, but the term 'ecosystem' has been broadened to describe non-natural organizations, underscoring a shift towards organic, decentralized structures."
