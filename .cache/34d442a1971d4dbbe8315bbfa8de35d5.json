  "summary": "The article explores the fragmentation of the internet, likening it to tectonic shifts, and argues that this splintering mirrors our evolving relationship with waste and resources. It introduces 'ecosystem architecture'â€”a practice driven by decentralization and regenerative design. Citing missteps and excesses in technological innovation, it calls for a more mindful, multi-disciplinary approach that values the regenerative potential of fragmented systems. Ultimately, this new perspective aims to rejuvenate communities and ecosystems, seeing fragments as seeds of possibility rather than remnants of the past.",
