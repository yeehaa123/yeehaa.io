  "summary": "The article 'Continental Drift' delves into the fragmentation of the internet, highlighting differences between global internet experiences. In countries like China and Russia, national controls are evident, while in Asia, superapps dominate. Africa relies on mesh and P2P networks for connectivity.

The article categorizes fragmentation into technical, governmental, and commercial. It critiques mainstream media's oversimplification by focusing on the 'OG internet' and urges a reevaluation of the internet's early promises.",
