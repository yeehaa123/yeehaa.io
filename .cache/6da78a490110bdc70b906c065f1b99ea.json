  "summary": "The article discusses the fragmentation of the internet, highlighting differences such as Asia's superapps, Africa's mesh networks, and appstore ecosystems. It traces the history of fragmentation to the 1990s, categorizing it into technical, governmental, and commercial fragmentation.

  "excerpt": "The internet's history shows that open access does not lead to universal consensus but rather to propaganda and division. Efforts by ISOC aim to address this by fostering a globally accessible web."
