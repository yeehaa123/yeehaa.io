  "summary": "Ecosystem architecture is a new practice that draws from diverse fields like philosophy, coding, and the arts to create healthy, non-natural ecosystems. Positioned at the intersection of decentralization and regenerative design, it aims to create distributed, asynchronous networks, ventures, and communities. While decentralized systems have driven economic progress, they also create waste. Regenerative design, however, focuses on renewing and revitalizing ecosystems, making them healthier and more vibrant. By embracing practices like Wabi-sabi and Kintsugi, ecosystem architecture seeks to build a promising future.",
