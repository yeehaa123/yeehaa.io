  "summary": "In biology, an ecosystem refers to a community of organisms interacting with their environment within a specific geographic area. This concept has been overextended in non-literal contexts like crypto, leading to cringeworthy uses. However, it reflects a desire for less hierarchical organizations. While natural ecosystems are territorial, modern ecosystems transcend space and time, driven by the internet. Successful decentralized organizations require new models and tools for 'Ecosystem Architecture,' inspired by diverse fields to promote thriving, non-hierarchical structures.",
