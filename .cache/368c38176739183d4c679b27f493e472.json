  "blurb": "The fragmentation of the internet mirrors both the Earth's tectonic shifts and the exploitative practices of the tech industry. Yet, brokenness does not imply worthlessness. Embracing fragmented systems, the article proposes 'ecosystem architecture,' a new approach inspired by decentralization and regenerative design. By fostering an interdisciplinary mix from philosophy to coding, the aim is to create vibrant, sustainable digital ecosystems.
