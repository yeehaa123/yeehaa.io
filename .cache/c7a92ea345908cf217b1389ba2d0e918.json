  "summary": "The article discusses the ubiquitous presence of metaphors in daily language that idealize wholeness and unity, making it difficult to view fragmentation positively. Philosopher Peter Sloterdijk's concept of \"foam\" in his Spheres trilogy counters this by celebrating multiplicity and rejecting the notion of a lost universal whole. The article argues for replacing the idea of \"internet fragmentation\" with \"internet foaming,\" highlighting the importance and positive aspects of bubblesâ€”despite their limitations like entrapment and solipsism. The focus should shift from trying to burst these bubbles to understanding and nurturing them as interconnected ecosystems.",
