  "summary": "Our everyday language is filled with metaphors that value wholeness or grieve its absence. Peter Sloterdijk, in his work 'Foams,' challenges this by celebrating multiplicity instead of universality, using the metaphor of foam to illustrate creative coexistence. The article critiques the negative perception of internet filter bubbles, suggesting they can foster connectivity and ecosystems, despite their drawbacks. It calls for embracing the bubbles' positive aspects while being aware of their limits without reverting to universal norms.",
